Abstract
========

The purpose of this MEP is to update the Mozart Website
to explain the new Mozart governance model.  The major
change is to replace the 'Research Groups' page by a new
page that explains the Mozart Board, the purpose of 
MEPs, and provides pointers to create and submit new
MEPs [#PAGE]_.


Rationale
=========

Now that the new Mozart governance rules are in place,
the Mozart website should explain them.  We propose to
replace the current 'Research Groups' page by a new
page that introduces the new governance model and
presents the Mozart Board.  Also, some other pages on
the Mozart website that mention the Mozart Consortium
need to be changed to mention the Mozart community
and Board instead.
