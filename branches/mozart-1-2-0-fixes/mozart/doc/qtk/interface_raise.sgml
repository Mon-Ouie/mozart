<ITEM> <<'raise'(1:W)>> : If the <<W>> argument is omitted then the command raises the widget so that it is above all of its siblings in
the stacking order (it will not be obscured by any siblings and will obscure any siblings that overlap it). If
<<W>> is specified then it must be an handle to another widget that is either a sibling of this widget or the
descendant of a sibling of this widget. In this case the <<'raise'>> command will insert this widget into the stacking order
just above <<W>>; this could end up either raising
or lowering window.
