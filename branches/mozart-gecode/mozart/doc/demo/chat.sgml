    <p>First a window pops up and prompts you for a file name in which
to save the <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.connection"
			/ticket/ which enables clients to join the
chat session.  If you want the ticket to be accessible to other
clients on the internet, you could create a file that can be accessed
through your http server.  For example, if I ask the server to save
the ticket into file
<file>/home/duchier/public_html/chien.et.chat</file>
then this ticket becomes available under my home page at url
<file>http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/chien.et.chat</file></p>
    <p>After the server has started, it leaves on your screen a button
that allows you to shut it down.</p>

    <title/Starting a Client/
    <p>When you start a client, it pops up a window where you must
enter the filename or URL where the ticket can be found for the chat
server to which you want to connect.  It also allows you to edit the
user name and host name which are used to identify you in the chat
session.  This identity is simply used as prefix to the messages that
you post so that everybody may know who said what; it has no other
purpose.</p>
