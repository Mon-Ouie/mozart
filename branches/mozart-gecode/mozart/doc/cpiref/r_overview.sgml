The value of the environment variable <var env proglang=sh/OZHOME/ is supposed to denote
the installation directory of the Oz 
system to be used.  The abstractions provided by the &cpi are defined
in the following header file.
<code proglang=sh display>$OZHOME/include/mozart_cpi.hh</code>
This file includes the file <file/mozart.h/ which provides the basic
functionality for interfacing Oz with &ccpp; code. For details
see <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:foreign">.

<para class=apropos proglang=cc><title/Naming Conventions/
The &cpi defines classes, functions,
macros etc. Their names begin with <<OZ_>>. 
Names of macros are made
up of upper case letters.  Member functions and data members begin with
lower case letters. The name of accessor functions begin with <<get>>
and names of predicates begin with <<is>>.
<p>
The &ccpp; compiler to be used is <em/gcc/ version 2.7.2 or higher.
