<ITEM> <<bitmap:B>> : Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget. The exact way in which the bitmap is
    displayed may be affected by other options such as anchor or justify. Typically, if this option is specified then it overrides other
    options that specify a textual value to display in the widget; the bitmap option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable a text
    display. In widgets that support both bitmap and image options, image will usually override bitmap. This parameter can't be get at runtime, however it can be set. <<B>> must be a valid bitmap (see <ptr to="misc.bitmap">)
