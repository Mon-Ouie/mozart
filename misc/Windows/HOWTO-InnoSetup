This document gives some guidelines to create a Mozart installer for Windows
using the InnoSetup script. The script was originally created by Filip
Konvicka, and includes some posterior modifications done by the community.

Assume that you made the Mozart installation on the $INSTALL directory. Now,
you neeed to copy the follwing files to that directory

Take the InnoSetup scripts from mozart/misc/Windows/

mozart.iss
ModifyPath.iss

And the images from /mozart/misc/

MozartBanner.bmp
MozartBitmap.bmp
MozartSide.bmp
MozartSmall.bmp

Since you have to do this on Windoze, you can go to the $INSTALL directory with
the "Windowse Explorer" and double click the mozart.iss script. That will open
InnoSetup. Then, run the script. You can do that with the menu button showing
the typical "Play" icon.

That will create the corresponding Mozart-1.3.2.exe file (with the correct
version number). That's the installer.
