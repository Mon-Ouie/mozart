<chapter id=chapter.text>
<title/Input and Output of Text/
<p>
The example in <ptr to=section.files.expand-a> resulted in a very inefficient
program: reading the entire file to a list and processing it afterwards
is extremely memory consuming.
<p>
A far better solution is to process the file incrementally
line by line. This pattern of reading files occurs in fact very often,
thus we provide support for it. The support provided is a mixin
class <<Open.text>>. This mixin class can be used together with files,
sockets, and pipes.

<section id="section.text.expand"><title/Expanding TAB Characters Revisited/
<p>
In <ptr to=prog-opprog-expandi/ the revised formulation of the
<<Expand>> procedure is shown. As before the file objects are created,
but now both files inherit from <<Open.text>> as well. This class
provides methods for buffered input and output.

The procedure <<Scan>> applies the input file object <<IF>> to the message
<<getS($)>>. It yields either <<false>>, in case the end of the file is
reached, or a string. This string contains exactly one line of the input
file (without a newline character).
<p>
The expansion of TAB characters is done in the function <<ScanLine>> as
before. The expanded lines are written with the <<putS>> method.
