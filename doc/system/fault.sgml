  <Title/Detecting and Handling Distribution Problems: <<Fault>>/

<P>This section summarizes the operations of the <<Fault>> module
and their argument types.  Please refer to the Distribution Tutorial for
more information on what the operations do and how to use them.

<section><title/Argument types/

<P>We summarize the argument types for the operations
in the <<Fault>> module.
<list>
<entry/<code/Entity//
<item>A reference to any Oz language entity
that may be an object, cell, lock, port, or logic variable.

<entry/<code/Level//
<item>One of <<global>>, <<site>>, or <<'thread'(T)>>,
where <<T>> is a thread reference or the atom <<this>>.

<entry/<code/FStates//
<item>A set of fault states, i.e., a list that can contain
at most one of each of
the elements <<tempFail>>, <<permFail>>,
<<remoteProblem(tempSome)>>,
<<remoteProblem(permSome)>>,
<<remoteProblem(tempAll)>>, and
<<remoteProblem(permAll)>>.

<entry/<code/OP//
<item>A record that indicates which attempted operation caused
the exception or handler invocation.
The value of <<OP>> is one of:
<list>
<item><<bind(T)>>, <<wait>>, <<isDet>> (for logic variables).
<item><<cellExchange(Old New)>>, <<cellAssign(New)>>,
<<cellAccess(Old)>> (for cells).
<item><<lock>> (for locks).
<item><<send(Msg)>> (for ports).
<item><<objectExchange(Attr Old New)>>,
<<objectAssign(Attr New)>>,
<<objectAccess(Attr Old)>>,
<<objectFetch>> (for objects).
A limitation of the current release is that an attempted
operation on an object cannot be retried.
</list>

<entry/<code/HandlerProc//
<item>A handler, i.e., a three-argument procedure
that is called as <<{HandlerProc Entity FStates OP}>>,
where <<FStates>> is a set of currently active fault states.
A handler replaces an attempted operation on an entity.

<entry/<code/WatcherProc//
<item>A watcher, i.e., a two-argument procedure
that is called in its own thread
as <<{WatcherProc Entity FStates}>>,
where <<FStates>> is a set of currently active fault states.
A watcher is invoked as soon as the site detects a fault.

</list>

<section><title/Fault information/

<P>When there is a distribution problem,
then three items of information are made available:
<list>
<item><<Entity>>: the entity whose operation does not succeed.
<item><<FStates>>: the fault states that are currently active.
This is a subset of the states that are being observed.
<item><<OP>>: the operation that is attempted but does not succeed.
</list>
<P>The system can be configured (see below) so that this information
appears in one or more of the following three ways:
<list>
<item>In an exception with format
<<system(dp(entity:Entity conditions:FStates op:OP) ...)>>.
<item>As arguments to a handler call, <<{HandlerProc Entity FStates OP}>>.
<item>As arguments to a watcher call, <<{WatcherProc Entity FStates}>>.
</list>
<P>A limitation of the current release is that if the problem
was detected during an object operation, then the <<Entity>>
argument is undefined.

<section><title/Operations/

<P>The <<Fault>> module contains the following operations.
All operations return a boolean flag <<B>> that is <<true>>
iff the operation succeeds.
All <<enable>> and <<install>>
operations succeed if nothing was enabled or installed
at that level.
All <<disable>> and <<deInstall>>
operations succeed if nothing was disabled or deinstalled
at that level.
At system startup, it is as if
<<{Fault.defaultEnable [tempFail permFail] _}>>
was executed successfully.

<list>
<entry/<code/{Fault.defaultEnable FStates ??{B}}//
<item>Enable default fault detection at the <<global>> level
for all entities created after this call.

<entry/<code/{Fault.defaultDisable ??{B}}//
<item>Disable default fault detection for all entities
created after this call.

<entry/<code/{Fault.enable Entity Level FStates ??{B}}//
<item>Enable fault detection on a given entity
at a given level for a given set of fault states.
An exception is raised if a fault is detected
when an operation is attempted on the entity.

<entry/<code/{Fault.disable Entity Level ??{B}}//
<item>Disable fault detection on a given entity
at a given level.

<entry/<code/{Fault.install Entity Level FStates HandlerProc ??{B}}//
<item>Install a handler for fault detection on a given entity
at a given level for a given set of fault states.
The handler <<{HandlerProc Entity AFStates OP}>> is called
if a fault is detected when an operation is attempted on the entity.
A limitation of the current release is that handlers
cannot be installed at the <<global>> level.

<entry/<code/{Fault.deInstall Entity Level ??{B}}//
<item>Deinstall a handler for fault detection on a given
entity at a given level.

<entry/<code/{Fault.installWatcher Entity FStates WatcherProc}//
<item>Install a watcher for fault detection on a given entity
for a given set of fault states.
More than one watcher can be installed on an entity.
Therefore this call always succeeds.
The watcher <<{WatcherProc Entity AFStates}>> is called
in its own thread as soon as the site detects a fault.

<entry/<code/{Fault.deInstallWatcher Entity WatcherProc}//
<item>Deinstall the given watcher on a given entity.
This call always succeeds.

</list>

<section><title/Limitations of the current release/

<P>The current release has the following limitations which
will be removed in future releases:
<list>
<item>If an exception is raised or a handler or watcher
is invoked for an object, then the argument <<Entity>>
is undefined.
<item>If an exception is raised or a handler is invoked
for an object, then the attempted object operation cannot
be retried.
<item>Handlers cannot be installed at the <<global>> level,
i.e., the call <<{Fault.install _ global _ _}>> is undefined.
If an attempt is made to install a <<global>> handler,
then a <<notImplemented>> exception is given.
</list>
