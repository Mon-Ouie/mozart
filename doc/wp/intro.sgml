    <Title/Graphical User Interfaces/
    <P>
      Mozart comes with an object-oriented interface to Tcl/Tk,
      a powerful tool for programming graphical user interfaces.  The
      functionality of all graphical objects comes in form of classes,
      which are subject to possibly multiple inheritance.  Windows are
      described compositionally by means of object hierarchies and are
      subject to dynamic and interactive modification.  
    <P>
      The interface substitutes &Oz; for the low-level Tcl (an event-driven
      script language).  By this, the interface inherits from &Oz; concurrency,
      objects and first-class procedures.  From Tcl/Tk the interface inherits
      a set of powerful graphical abstractions.  The large number of available
      graphical abstractions built on top of Tcl/Tk can be integrated
      smoothly.

    <p>
      One particular advantage of using Tk as graphics engine for
      Mozart is the wealth of excellent documentation for Tcl and Tk.

    <p>
      A must read (or at least see or browse) in this particular
respect is the original <Ref to="Ousterhout.94"/book/ of John
Osterhout. A very fascinating account on how to employ the graphical
primitive in Tk for developing high-level graphical applications is
<Ptr to="HarrisonMcLennan.98">.

    <p>
      The definitive entry point into the full collection of Tcl/Tk
related resources and informations is the web page at <Ref.extern
to="http://www.scriptics.com/"/Scriptics/, a company co-founded by John
Ousterhout.

    <p>
      The details of all commands and widgets for Tcl and Tk can be
found in the manpages that ship with the Tcl and Tk distributions. For
convenience, the Mozart release includes HTML versions of <Ref.extern
to="../tcltk/contents.htm"/them/, which carry the following <Ref.extern to="../tcltk/copyright.htm"/copyright/.
