<Chapter id="chapter.widgets-1">
  <Title/Widgets/

  <P>
    This chapter introduces some of the widget objects the Tcl/Tk
    interface provides.  Examples illustrate the most common options and
    the values they can take.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.toplevel">
    <Title/Toplevel Widgets and Widget Objects/

    <P>
      A toplevel widget serves as the outermost container for other widgets.
      It can be created from the class <<Tk.toplevel>> and can be initialized
      by applying it to a message with label <<tkInit>>.  An example is shown
      in <Ptr to="picture.widgets-1.toplevel">.  The features <<width>> and
      <<height>> of the message together with their values specify that the
      toplevel widget is 150 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.

    <p>
      <Figure class=picture id="picture.widgets-1.toplevel">
        <Caption/Creating a toplevel widget./
        <P>
          <Picture.Extern to="toplevel-1.gif" type=gif>
<chunk class=anonymous><title/{Tk.toplevel tkInit}/
T={New Tk.toplevel tkInit(width:150 height:50)}
</chunk>
      </Figure>

    <P>
      Creating and initializing a widget object creates a graphical image
      for the widget object.  We will refer to the graphical image just as
      the widget.  Most often we will not distinguish between the object and
      its widget.  A toplevel widget is special in that its graphical image
      appears immediately on the screen after the widget object has been
      initialized.  Other widgets require to be managed by a so-called
      geometry manager before they appear on the screen.  In <Ptr
      to="chapter.geometry"> we will discuss geometry managers.

    <P>
      A widget object can be sent a message with label <<tk>> to change the
      appearance or behaviour of its widget. For example, the background
      color of the toplevel widget <<T>> can be changed to purple by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/{Tk.toplevel tk(configure)}/
{T tk(configure background:purple)}
</chunk>
      Additionally, widget objects understand messages with label <<tkReturn>>
      to query the state of a widget.  We will discuss these messages later.

    <P>
      A widget object can be closed by applying the object to the message
      <<tkClose>>.  Closing the widget object also destroys the widget
      displayed on the screen.  <Ptr to="section.widgets-1.hierarchy">
      contains more details how widget objects are closed.

    <P>
      The structure of messages with labels <<tkInit>>, <<tk>> and <<tkReturn>>
      depend on the particular widget under consideration.  However, all of
      these messages share a common structure.  The following section
      explains this structure and shows how to build messages such that they
      are understood by widgets.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.tickles">
    <Title/The GUI Agent, Tickles and Widget Messages/

    <P>
      Widget objects as well as instances of other classes defined in the
      <<Tk>> module are built as object oriented frontends to a single
      graphical agent, the so-called <Def/GUI agent/.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/The GUI Agent/

      <P>
        The GUI agent receives messages and executes them.  By executing a
        message the GUI agent creates widgets, configures the appearance and
        behaviour of widgets, or computes a geometry for the layout of a
        widget on the screen.

      <P>
        The messages the GUI agent understands are so-called <Def/tickles/.
        The procedures <<Tk.send>> and <<Tk.batch>> take a tickle or a list of
        tickles and send it to the GUI agent.  We will use these two precedures
        especially to send tickles for geometry management, as will be
        discussed in <Ptr to="chapter.geometry">.

      <P>
        Messages send to widget objects and other objects the Tk interface
        provides are translated in a straightforward way to tickles.  These
        tickles are then send to the GUI agent.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Tickles and Messages/

      <P>
        Tickles are used to describe messages for the GUI agent.  A tickle is
        either a boolean value, the name <<unit>>, a virtual string, a record
        that has neither a name as label nor as feature, or a so-called tickle
        object.  A tickle object is an instance of a class the Tk module
        provides.

      <P>
        An initilaization message with label <<tkInit>> must be a record
        without integer features.  The values for a feature must be a
        tickle.  Only the special features <<parent>>, <<action>>, and <<args>>
        may take different values.  These features we will discuss later.

      <P>
        To the features we refer to as <Def/configuration options/, or
        short as <Def/options/.  Their values we refer to as <Def
        /option values/.

      <P>
        A message with label <<tk>> must be a record with at least a single
        integer feature and maybe some other integer features and some
        options.  The value of the first integer feature we call the
        <Def/command/, whereas we refer to the remaining values for the
        integer features as <Def/arguments/.  For example, in the message
        <<<tk(set active backgound:purple)>>>
        <<set>> is the command, <<active>> is the single argument, and
        <<background>> is an option with value <<purple>>.

    <SubSection>
      <Title>Tickles and Tcl/Tk</Title>

      <P>
        According to the messages the gui manager receives
        When the gui manager executes the messages
        For example,
        <<<example("test" 1 2.0 side:left(right:true) fill:x)>>>
        describes the string
        <<<"example test 1 2.0 -side left -right 1 -fill x">>>
        Explain commands and configuration options.  Values given for
        configuration options are <Def/tickles/.  A tickle is data structure
        for the convenient description of values.

      <P>
        A tickle value is either a boolean value (&ie;, <<true>> or <<false>>),
        a virtual string, or a record with atomic label and atomic or integer
        features, where the fields of the record is a tickle itself.

      <P>
        Additionally, all objects created as instances of widget classes are
        tickles.

      <P>
        Why do we need tickles.

      <P>
        How can we look up options.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.frame">
    <Title/Frames/

    <P>
      Frame widgets are similar to toplevel widgets in that they serve as
      containers for other widgets.  The difference is that a frame is used
      as container within other widgets, whereas a toplevel is the outermost
      container.  The main purpose of frames is to determine geometrical
      layouts for the widgets they contain.  More on geometry management we
      will see in <Ptr to="chapter.geometry">.

    <SubSection id="section.widgets-1.relief">
      <Title/Relief Options/

      <P>
        Frames support the <<relief>> and <<borderwidth>> options.  These
        options determine a three dimensional border to be drawn around
        a frame.  The values for the <<relief>> option must be one of
        <<groove>>, <<ridge>>, <<flat>>, <<sunken>>, and <<raised>>.  The
        different styles of borders which correspond to theses values are
        shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames">.

      <P>
        <Figure id="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames">
          <Caption/Frame widgets with different values for relief./
          <P>
            <Picture.Extern to="relief-frames.gif" type=gif>
<chunk class=anonymous><title/Tk.frame/
Fs={Map [groove ridge flat sunken raised]
    fun {$ R}
       {New Tk.frame tkInit(parent:T width:2#c height:1#c
                            relief:R borderwidth:4)}
    end}
{{Nth Fs 3} tk(configure background:black)}
{Tk.send pack(b(Fs) side:left padx:4 pady:4)}
</chunk>
        </Figure>

      <P>
        The <<tkInit>> message contains the option <<parent>> which links the
        frames into its parent, the toplevel widget&nbsp;<<T>>.  All widgets
        but toplevels need a parent widget, this is discussed in <Ptr
        to="section.widgets-1.hierarchy">.

      <P>
        The program shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames"> maps the
        list of relief option values to frame objects.  To make the frame with
        the option <<flat>> visible, its background is configured to be black.

      <P>
        Note that we left out the code to create the toplevel widget.  Here
        and in the following we assume that the variable&nbsp;<<T>> is bound
        to a toplevel widget.  The example file, however, contains the code
        needed to create the toplevel widget.

      <P>
        The exact meaning of the <<pack>> command used in this example will be
        explained in <Ptr to="section.geometry.pack">.

    <SubSection id="section.widgets-1.distances">
      <Title/Screen Distance Options/
      <P>
        As value for the <<borderwidth>> option we used an integer in the
        example shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames">.  Just
        giving a number specifies a distance in <Def/screen pixels/.  If
        the number is followed by one of the letters <<c>>, <<m>>, <<i>>,
        and&nbsp;<<p>> the screen distance is given in centimeters,
        millimeters, inches (2.54 centimeters), or printers' points
        (<math.choice><math html>1/72</math><math latex>1/72</math>
        </math.choice> inch).
      <P>
        A convenient way to specify screen distances that employ units is
        to use a virtual string that appends the unit letter to the number,
        as used in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames">.
    <SubSection id="section.widgets-1.color">
      <Title/Color Options/
      <P>
        To make the frame with the <<relief>> option <<flat>> visible, we
        configured the background color to be black. Color options can be
        given either symbolically or numerically.
      <P>
        A symbolic color value can be given as virtual string like <<black>>,
        <<"red">>, or <<"dArK"#blUe>>, where the capitalization does not have
        any significance.  A list of valid color names you can find in the file
        <File display>$OZHOME/demo/documentation/misc/colors.oz</File>
        <!--** is the above still correct? -->
      <P>
        A numerical color value is determined by three integers between <<0>>
        and <<255>>.  The three integers describe the red, green, and blue part
        of the color.  A numerical color value in &Oz; can be specified by a
        ternary tuple with label&nbsp;<<c>>, where the three fields of the
        tuple are the three integers.  For example, the base colors red, green,
        and blue are described by the tuples <<c(255 0 0)>>, <<c(0 255 0)>>,
        and <<c(0 0 255)>> respectively.
      <P>
        Two examples that make frequent use of color options can
        be found in <Ptr to="section.widgets-2.scale"> and <Ptr
        to="section.widgets-2.listbox">.
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Abbreviations and Synonyms/
      <P>
      Some of the most common options have the following synonyms:
      <Table>
        <TR>
          <TD><<background>>
          <TD><<bg>>
        <TR>
          <TD><<foreground>>
          <TD><<fg>>
        <TR>
          <TD><<borderwidth>>
          <TD><<bd>>
      </Table>
      Besides of synonyms it is possible to abbreviate options provided that
      the abbreviation is unambiguous.  For example, it is correct to
      abbreviate the <<background>> option by <<ba>> but not by <<b>> since
      <<b>> is also an abbreviation for <<bitmap>> and <<borderwidth>>.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.hierarchy">
    <Title/The Widget Hierarchy/

    <P>
      Widgets are arranged in a hierarchy.  Each widget has a single parent.
      The only exceptions can be toplevel widget objects, which do not have
      to have a parent.  The parent of a widget is given by the option
      <<parent>> in the <<tkInit>> message.  Usually parent widgets are
      containers.  To the parent of a widget we also refer to as its master.
      To the widget itself we refer to as slave of its master.

    <P>
      For example, in the previous example shown in <Ptr
      to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames"> the five frame widgets
      are slaves of the single toplevel widget.

    <P>
      The purpose of the hierarchy is threefold:
      <List enum>
        <Item>
          The geometry for widgets is computed according to the hierarchy.
          This is discussed in <Ptr to="chapter.geometry">.
        <Item>
          Creation and initialization has to follow the hierarchy.  To
          initialize a widget object is is necessary that its parent widget
          object is already created and initialized.  Otherwise initialization
          of a slave blocks until its master is initialized.
        <Item>
          Closing a parent widget object also closes all its slaves.  The
          slaves are closed by applying them to the <<close>> message.  A
          widget object gets closed and its widget gets destroyed only after
          all of its slaves have been closed.  This implies that if a slave
          does not serve the <<close>> message, because another message is
          being served, the master does not close itself.
      </List>
      After a widget object has been closed, using it in tickles sent
      directly to the GUI agent, &eg; by <<Tk.send>> or <<Tk.batch>>, issues
      a runtime error.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.label">
    <Title/Label Widgets/

    <P>
      A <Def/label/ widget displays a text string or a bitmap.  Options for
      frames are also valid options for labels, additional options determine
      what the label displays.

    <p>
      <Figure id="figure.widgets-1.labels">
        <Caption/Example for labels displaying bitmaps and text./

    <P>
      <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.labels"> shows an example where the label
      <<L1>> displays a bitmap and the label <<L2>> displays text.  As with
      other widgets, the options of a label widget can be reconfigured by
      sending the widget object a <<tk>> message with the command
      <<configure>>.  Execution of the following expression changes the
      bitmap to an exclamation mark:
      <<<{L1 tk(configure bitmap:warning)}>>>

    <SubSection id="section.widgets-1.bitmap">
      <Title/Bitmap Options/

      <P>
        Label widgets and several other widgets allow to display bitmaps.
        There are two different kinds of bitmaps: predefined bitmaps and
        bitmaps stored in files.

      <P>
        If the first character of the <<bitmap>> option value is an <File/@/,
        the value is interpreted as filename.  For instance, feeding
<chunk class=anonymous><title/Bitmap Options/
{L2 tk(configure bitmap: '@'#{Property.get 'oz.home'}#
                         '/share/images/compiler.xbm')}

        relative to where Mozart system has been installed, that is relative
        to <<{Property.get 'oz.home'}>>.

      <P>
        If the first character is different from <File/@/, it is interpreted
        as the name of a predefined bitmap.  A table of all predefined bitmaps

    <SubSection id="section.widgets-1.fonts">
      <Title/Font Options/

      <P>
        A font to be used for displaying text can be specified by the <<font>>
        option. Valid values for the <<font>> option are either
        platform specific font names or instances of the class
        <<Tk.font>>. An instance of the class <<Tk.font>> are also
        tickle objects but are different from widget objects.

      <p>
        Platform dependent font names are for example X font names. If
        you are running a Unix based system, you can for example
        display the available names by using the <kbd/xlsfonts/
        program.

      <p>
        However the preferred way to specify fonts is to be platform
        independent of course. The program in <Ptr

                                          Family#' font.')
                                 font:   F)}

     end}
 end}
</chunk>

      <p>
        The init message for creating a font determines with the options
        <<family>> (the style of the font), <<weight>> (whether it is
        bold or normal), and <<size>> (how large is the font in point,
        if the number is positive, in pixels if it is less than zero)
        how the font looks. <<Tk.font>> supports more options, for a
        complete overview consult <Ref.extern
        to="&tkcmd;/font.htm"/<kbd/font//.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.images">
    <Title/Images/

    <P>
      Besides of text and bitmaps labels can display images.  Images differ
      from bitmaps in that they allow for more than two colors to be
      displayed.

    <P>
      Images are provided as objects in &Oz;.  These objects are also tickle
      objects (see <Ptr to="section.widgets-1.tickles">), but are different
      from widget objects.

    <P>
      <Figure id="figure.widgets-1.images">
        <Caption/Three labels displaying the same image./
        <P>
          <Picture.Extern to="images-1.gif" type=gif>
<chunk class=anonymous><title/Tk.image/
I  = {New Tk.image
      tkInit(type:photo format:gif
             file:{System.get home}#'/demo/bitmaps/trucks/truck-left.gif')}
L1 = {New Tk.label tkInit(parent:T image:I)}

L3 = {New Tk.label tkInit(parent:T image:I)}
{Tk.send pack(L1 L2 L3 padx:1#m pady:1#m side:left)}
</chunk>


    <P>
      The program in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.images"> creates an image object
      and displays the image in three labels.  Changing the configuration of
      the image, changes the displayed image in all label widgets. For example,
      feeding the following expression
<<<{I tk(configure
      file:{System.get home}#
           '/demo/bitmaps/trucks/truck-right.gif')}>>>
      replaces all three displayed trucks by trucks heading in the inverse
      direction.

    <P>
      Images can be of two different types.  The value of the <<type>>
      configuration option can be <<photo>> (as in our example), or <<bitmap>>.
      If the type is <<photo>>, the image can display files in two different
      formats.  The format is specified by the <<format>> option.  Valid
      values for the <<format>> option are <<gif>> and <<ppm>>.
    <P>
      In case the value for the <<type>> option is <<bitmap>>, the value given
      for the <<file>> option must be a valid bitmap file.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.messages">
    <Title/Messages/
    <P>
      Message widgets display text extending over several lines.  How the
      text is distributed over several lines is determined by one of the
      options <<width>> and <<aspect>>.  Each of the line is justified
      according to the value of the option <<justify>>.  Possible values
      are <<left>> (the default value), <<center>>, and <<right>>.  <Ptr
      to="figure.widgets-1.messages"> shows the result of different
      combinations of aspect and justification.
      <Figure id="figure.widgets-1.messages">
        <Caption/Messages with <<justify>> and <<aspect>> options./
        <P>
          <Picture.Extern to="messages.gif" type=gif>
<<<T={New Tk.toplevel tkInit(bg:white)}
S ='Text extending over several lines.'
Ms={Map [left#200 center#100 right#50]
    fun {$ J#A}
       {New Tk.message tkInit(parent:T text:S justify:J aspect:A)}
    end}
{Tk.send pack(b(Ms) side:left padx:2#m pady:2#m)}>>>
      </Figure>
    <P>
      If the option <<width>> is present, the value (a screen distance, see
      <Ptr to="section.widgets-1.distances">) gives the length of each line.
      If no <<width>> option is present, the aspect ratio between height
      and width of the text is given by the option <<aspect>>.  The value
      specifies the aspect as
      <<<100 * ?{width} / ?{height}>>>
      For example a value of <<100>> means that the text is as high
      as wide, a value of <<200>> means that the text is twice as wide
      as high.
