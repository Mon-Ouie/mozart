<Chapter id="chapter.intro"><Title>Introduction
<P>
    The <SPAN CLASS=cite>Gump</SPAN>
    is a fictional `creature' in the children's
    novel <Q/The Marvelous Land of Oz/ by L.&nbsp;Frank Baum, sequel to
    <REF TO="OzWizard" CLASS=bib><Q/The Wonderful Wizard of Oz/</REF>.
    It is a living flying machine assembled by the main characters from
    individually selected materials.  The Tin Woodman fastens a gump's head
    to one end of the machine, explaining that it <Q/will show which is the
    front end of the Thing./
<P>
    <SPAN CLASS=cite>Gump</SPAN>
    is also the name of the specification language and
    tool described in this handbook from the user's point of view.  Like
    the gump's head in the novel, the language is used to specify front-ends
    in Oz, in this case the lexical and phrase structure of a language.
    The tool is the <Q/Powder of Life/ that generates executable programs
    (Oz classes) from such specifications.
<SECTION CLASS=unnumbered><TITLE>Overview
<P>
      This manual consists of two parts.  <PTR TO="chapter.scanner"
      CLASS="Chapter"> describes the Gump Scanner Generator;
      <PTR TO="chapter.parser" CLASS="Chapter"> the Gump Parser
      Generator.  Each chapter is divided in two sections, the first
      explaining the basic concepts by example and the second providing a
      more detailed reference for the programmer.
<SECTION CLASS=unnumbered><TITLE>Acknowledgements

      The specification language and the software tool have been designed and
      implemented as the subject of my <REF TO="kornstaedt96"
      CLASS=bib>Master's
      Thesis</REF> which has been supervised by Prof.&nbsp;Dr.
      Gert Smolka and Dipl.-Inform. Christian Schulte at the Programming
      Systems Lab at the Universität des Saarlandes, as well as by
      Prof.&nbsp;Dr. Hans-Wilm Wippermann at the University of Kaiserslautern.

      The software makes use of the GNU variants of
