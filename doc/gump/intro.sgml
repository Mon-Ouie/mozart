  <Title/Introduction/
  <P>
    The <Name type=creature>Gump</Name> is a fictional `creature' in the
    children's novel <Q class=quotation>The Marvelous Land of Oz</Q> by
    L.&nbsp;Frank Baum, sequel to <Q class=title>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</Q
    >&nbsp;<Ptr to="baum00">.  It is a living flying machine assembled by
    the main characters from individually selected materials.  The Tin Woodman
    fastens a gump's head to one end of the machine, explaining that it
    <Q class=quotation>will show which is the front end of the Thing.</Q>
  <P>
    &Gump; is also the name of the specification language and tool described
    in this handbook from the user's point of view.  Like the gump's head in
    the novel, the language is used to specify front-ends in &Oz;, in this
    case the lexical and phrase structure of a language.  The tool is the
    <Q class=quotation>Powder of Life</Q> that generates executable programs
    (&Oz; class definitions) from such specifications.

    <P>
      This manual consists of two parts.  <Ptr to="chapter.scanner"> describes
      the &Gump; Scanner Generator; <Ptr to="chapter.parser"> the &Gump; Parser
      Generator.  Each chapter is divided in two sections, the first explaining
      the basic concepts by example and the second providing a detailed
      reference for the programmer.

    <Title/Acknowledgements/
    <P>
      The specification language and the software tool have been designed
      and implemented as the subject of my Master's Thesis&nbsp;<Ptr
      to="kornstaedt96"> which has been supervised by Prof&dot;&nbsp;Dr&dot;
      Gert Smolka and Dipl&dot;-Inform&dot; Christian Schulte at the
      Programming Systems Lab at the Universität des Saarlandes, as well
      as by Prof&dot;&nbsp;Dr&dot; Hans-Wilm Wippermann at the University
      of Kaiserslautern.
    <P>
      The software makes use of the GNU variants of &lex; and &yacc;,
      called &flex;&nbsp;<Ptr to="paxson95"> and &bison;&nbsp;<Ptr
      to="donellystallman95"> respectively.

      &Oz; is the name of a programming language developed at the Programming
      Systems Lab at the Universität des Saarlandes.  Mozart is an
      implementation of &Oz;.
