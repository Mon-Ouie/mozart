  <TITLE>Basic Operations and Examples</TITLE>

<SECTION><TITLE>Global naming</TITLE>

<P>Global names are needed when an application
wants to interact with the world outside it.
Mozart supports three basic kinds of global names:
<index/ticket/
<index/global name<and>ticket/
<LIST>
<ITEM> A <EM>ticket</EM> is a string that references a data
structure inside a running application.
Tickets can be created by Mozart and
used by active applications to connect themselves
(see module <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system"
key="chapter.connection"/<<Connection>>/).
<index/URL/
<index/global name<and>URL/
<ITEM> A <EM>URL</EM> is a string that references
a file across the network.
The string follows the standard URL syntax.
<index/pickle/
<index/stateless entity<and>pickle/
In Mozart the file can be a <EM>pickle</EM>, in which case
it can hold any kind of stateless data--procedures,
classes, functors, records, strings, and so forth
(see module <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system"
key="chapter.pickle"/<<Pickle>>/).
<index/hostname/
<index/global name<and>hostname/
<ITEM> A <EM>hostname</EM> is a string that
refers to a host (another machine) across the network.
The string follows the standard DNS syntax.
An application can use the hostname to start up a
Mozart process on the host
(see module <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system"
key="chapter.remote"/<<Remote>>/).
</LIST>
<P>For maximum flexibility,
these three types can be represented as
virtual strings inside Oz.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Connecting applications by means of tickets</TITLE>

<P>Let's say Application 1 has a stream that
it wants others to access.
It can do this by creating a ticket
that references the stream.
Other applications then just need to know
the ticket to get access to the stream.
Tickets are implemented by
the module <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system"
key="chapter.connection"/<<Connection>>/,
which has the following three operations:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <<{Connection.offer X T}>> creates
a ticket <<T>> for <<X>>, which can be any language entity.
The ticket can be taken just once.
Attempting to
take a ticket more than once will raise an exception.
<ITEM> <<{Connection.offerUnlimited X T}>> creates
a ticket <<T>> for <<X>>, which can be any language entity.
The ticket can be taken any number of times.
<ITEM> <<{Connection.take T X}>> creates a reference <<X>>
when given a valid ticket in <<T>>.
The <<X>> refers to exactly the same language entity
as the original reference that was offered when
the ticket was created.
A ticket can be taken at any site.
If taken at a different site than where the ticket was offered,
then there is network communication between the two sites.
</LIST>
<P>Application 1 first creates a ticket for the stream
as follows:

<<<
declare Stream Tkt in
{Connection.offerUnlimited Stream Tkt}
{Show Tkt}
>>>

<index/ticket<and>example/
<P>The ticket is returned in <<Tkt>>.
Application 1 then publishes the value of <<Tkt>> somewhere so that
other applications can access it.
Our example uses <<Show>> to display
the ticket in the emulator window.
We will use copy and paste to communicate the ticket
to another application.
The ticket looks something like
<<'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'>>.
Don't worry about exactly what's inside this strange atom.
Users don't normally see tickets:
they are stored in files or passed across the network,
e.g., in mail messages.
Application 2 can use the ticket to get a reference
to the stream:

<<<
declare Stream in
{Connection.take
   'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'
   Stream}
{Browse Stream}
>>>

<P>If Application 1 binds the stream
by doing <<Stream=a|b|c|_>>
then Application 2's browse window will show the bindings.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Persistent data structures</TITLE>

<index/pickle<and>example/
<P>An application can save
any stateless data structure
in a file and load it again from a file.
The loading may also be done from a URL,
used as a file's global name.
The module <<Pickle>> implements the saving
and loading and the conversion between Oz data
and a byte sequence.

<P>For example, let's define a function and save it:

<<<
declare
fun {Fact N}
   if N=<1 then 1 else N*{Fact N-1} end
end

{Pickle.save Fact "~pvr/public_html/fact"}
>>>

<P>Since the function is in a <<public_html>> directory,
anyone can load it by giving a URL that specifies
the file:

<<<
declare
Fact={Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/fact"}

{Browse {Fact 10}}
>>>

<P>Anything stateless can be saved in a pickle,
including functions, procedures, classes,
functors, records, and atoms.
Stateful entities, such as objects and variables,
cannot be pickled.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Remote computations and functors</TITLE>

<index/remote computation<and>example/
<P>An application can start a computation
on a remote host
that uses the resources of that host and
that continues to interact with the application.
The computation is specified as a functor,
which is the standard way to
define computations with the resources they need.

<P>First we create a new Mozart process
that is ready to accept new computations:
<<<
declare
R={New Remote.manager init(host:"sinuhe.sics.se")}
>>>

<P>Let's make the process do some work.
We define a functor that does the work
when we evaluate it:
<<<
declare F M
F=functor export x:X define X={Fact 30} end

M={R apply(F $)}

{Browse M.x}
>>>

<P>The result <<X>> is returned to the client site in the module <<M>>,
which is calculated on the remote site and returned to the
application site.
The module is a record and
the result is at the field <<x>>, namely <<M.x>>.
The module should not reference any resources.
If it does, an exception will be raised in the thread
doing the <<apply>>.

<index/remote computation<and>of a statement (needing resources)/
<P>Any Oz statement ?{S} can be executed
remotely by creating a functor:
<code display
/F=functor import ?{ResourceList} export ?{Results} define ?{S} end/
To evaluate this functor remotely,
the client executes <<M={R apply(F $)}>>.
The ?{ResourceList} must list all the resources used by ?{S}.
If not all are listed then an exception will be raised in the
thread doing the <<apply>>.
The remote execution will use the resources of the remote site
and return a module <<M>> that contains all the fields mentioned
in ?{Results}.
If ?{S} does not use any resources, then there is
a slightly simpler way to do remote computations.
The next section shows how by building a simple
compute server.

<P>A second solution is to use a functor with
an external reference:
<<<
declare F M X in
F=functor define {Fact 30 X} end

M={R apply(F $)}
{Browse X}
>>>

<P>This functor is not stateless,
but it's all right since we are not pickling the functor.
In fact, it's quite possible for
functors to have external references.
<index/computed functor/
<index/functor<and>computed/
Such functors are called <em>computed functors</em>.
They can only be pickled if the external references
are to stateless entities.

<P>A third solution
is for the functor itself
to install the compute server on the remote site.
This is a more general solution:
it <EM>separates</EM> the distribution aspect
(setting up the remote site to do the right thing)
from the particular computations that we want to do.
We give this solution later in the tutorial.

<SECTION><TITLE>Servers</TITLE>

<index/server/
<P>A server is a long-lived computation that provides a service to clients.
We will show progressively how to build different kinds of servers.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>The hello server</TITLE>

<P>Let's build a basic server that returns the string <<"Hello world">>
to clients.
The first step is to create the server.
Let's do this and also make the server available through a URL:
<<<
% Create server
declare Str Prt Srv in
{NewPort Str Prt}
thread
   {ForAll Str proc {$ S} S="Hello world" end}
end
proc {Srv X}
   {Send Prt X}
end

% Make server available through given URL:
{Pickle.save {Connection.offerUnlimited Srv} "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/hw"}
>>>
<P>All the above must be executed on the server site.
Later on we will show how a client can create a
server remotely.

<P>Any client that knows the URL can access the server:
<<<
declare Srv in
Srv={Connection.take {Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/hw"}}

local X in
   {Srv X}
   {Browse X}
end
>>>
<P>This will show <<"Hello world">> in the browser window.

<P>By taking the connection,
the client gets a reference to the server.
This conceptually merges the client and server computation spaces
into a single computation space.
The client and server can then communicate as if
they were in the same process.
Later on, when the client forgets the server reference,
the computation spaces become separate again.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>The hello server with stationary objects</TITLE>

<index/stationary object<and>example/
<P>The previous section shows how to build a basic server
using a port to collect messages.
There is in fact a much simpler way,
namely by using stationary objects.
Here's how to create the server:
<<<
declare
class HelloWorld
   meth hw(X) X="Hello world" end
end

Srv={NewStat HelloWorld hw(_)} % Requires an initial method
>>>
<P>The client calls the server as <<{Srv hw(X)}>>.
The class <<HelloWorld>> can be replaced by any class.
The only difference between this and creating
a centralized object is that <<New>> is replaced by <<NewStat>>.
This specifies the distributed semantics of the object
independently of the object's class.

<SUBSECTION id="making.stationary.objects"><TITLE>Making stationary objects</TITLE>

<index/stationary object<and>definition/
<index/object<and>stationary/
<P>Stationary entities are a very important abstraction.
Mozart provides two operations to
make entities stationary.
The first is creating a stationary object:
<<<
declare
Object={NewStat Class Init}
>>>
<P>When executed on a site,
the procedure <<NewStat>> takes a class and an initial message
and creates an object that is stationary on that site.
We define <<NewStat>> as follows.

<chunk><title/Stationary object/
declare
<chunk.ref/MakeStat definition/

proc {NewStat Class Init Object}
   Object={MakeStat {New Class Init}}
end
</chunk>

<P>A fault-tolerant version of <<NewStat>> is given in <ptr to="guard.based">.
<<NewStat>> is defined in terms of <<MakeStat>>.
The procedure <<MakeStat>> takes an object or a one-argument
procedure and returns a one-argument procedure that
obeys exactly the same language semantics and is stationary.
We define <<{MakeStat PO StatP}>> as follows, where
input <<PO>> is an object or a one-argument procedure
and output <<StatP>> is a one-argument procedure.
<NOTE FOOT>One-argument procedures are not exactly
objects, since they do not have features.
For all practical purposes not requiring features,
though, one-argument procedures
and objects are interchangeable.</NOTE>

<chunk><title/MakeStat definition/
proc {MakeStat PO ?StatP}
   S P={NewPort S}
   N={NewName}
in
   % Client side:
   proc {StatP M}
   R in
      {Send P M#R}
      if R==N then skip else raise R end end
   end
   % Server side:
   thread
      {ForAll S
       proc {$ M#R}
          thread
             try {PO M} R=N catch X then R=X end
          end
       end}
   end
end
</chunk>

<P><<StatP>> preserves exactly the same language semantics
as <<PO>>.  That is, it has the same concurrency
behavior and it raises the same exceptions.
The new name <<N>> is a globally-unique token.
This ensures that
there is no conflict with any exceptions
raised by <<ProcOrObj>>.


<SUBSECTION id="compute.server"><TITLE>A compute server</TITLE>

<index/compute server/
<index/server<and>compute server/
<P>One of the promises of distributed computing is making
computations go faster by exploiting the parallelism
inherent in networks of computers.
A first step is to create a compute server, that is,
a server that accepts any computation and uses
its computational resources to do the computation.
Here's one way to create a compute server:
<<<
declare
class ComputeServer
   meth init skip end
   meth run(P) {P} end
end

C={NewStat ComputeServer init}
>>>
<P>The compute server can be made available through a URL
as shown before.
Here's how a client uses the compute server:
<<<
declare
fun {Fibo N}
   if N<2 then 1 else {Fibo N-1}+{Fibo N-2} end
end

% Do first computation remotely
local F in
   {C run(proc {$} F={Fibo 30} end)}
   {Browse F}
end

% Do second computation locally
local F in
   F={Fibo 30}
   {Browse F}
end
>>>
<P>This first does the computation
remotely and then repeats it locally.
In the remote case, the variable <<F>>
is shared between the client and server.
When the server binds it, its value
is immediately sent to the server.
This is how the client gets a result from the server.

<index/remote computation<and>of a statement (not needing resources)/
<P>Any Oz statement <EM>S</EM> that does not use resources
can be executed remotely by making a procedure out of it:
<code display
/P=proc {$} ?{S} end/
To run this, the client just executes <<{C run(P)}>>.
Because Mozart is fully network-transparent,
?{S} can be any statement
in the language: for example,
?{S} can define new classes
inheriting from client classes.
If ?{S} uses resources, then it can be
executed remotely by means of functors.
This is shown in the previous section.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>A compute server with functors</TITLE>

<P>The solution of the previous section
is reasonable when the client and server
are independent computations that connect.
Let's now see how the
client itself can start up a compute
server on a remote site.
The client first creates a new Mozart process:
<<<
declare
R={New Remote.manager init(host:"sinuhe.sics.se")}
>>>

<P>Then the client sends a functor
to this process that, when evaluated,
creates a compute server:
<<<
declare F C
F=functor
  export cs:CS
  define
     class ComputeServer
        meth init skip end
        meth run(P) {P} end
     end
     CS={NewStat ComputeServer init}
  end

C={R apply(F $)}.cs  % Set up the compute server
>>>

<P>The client can use the compute server as before:
<<<
local F in
   {C run(proc {$} F={Fibo 30} end)}
   {Browse F}
end
>>>


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>A dynamically-extensible server</TITLE>

<index/server<and>dynamically-extensible/
<P>Sometimes a server has to be upgraded,
for example
to add extra functionality or to fix a bug.
We show how to upgrade a server
without stopping it.
<index/Java<and>limitation/
This cannot be done in Java.
In practice, the upgrade can even
be done interactively.
A person sits down at a terminal anywhere
in the world, starts up an interactive Mozart
session, and upgrades the server while it is running.

<P>Let's first define a generic upgradable server:
<<<
declare
proc {NewUpgradableStat Class Init ?Upg ?Srv}
   Obj={New Class Init}
   C={NewCell Obj}
in
   Srv={MakeStat
          proc {$ M} {{Access C} M} end}
   Upg={MakeStat
          proc {$ Class2#Init2} {Assign C {New Class2 Init2}} end}
end
>>>
<P>This definition must be executed
on the server site.
It returns a server <<Srv>> and a stationary procedure
<<Upg>> used for upgrading the server.
The server is upgradable because it does
all object calls indirectly through the cell <<C>>.

<P>A client creates an upgradable compute server almost
exactly as it creates a fixed compute server,
by executing the following on the server site:
<<<
declare Srv Upg in
Srv={NewUpgradableStat ComputeServer init Upg}
>>>
<P>Let's now upgrade the compute server while
it is running.
We first define a new class <<CComputeServer>>
and then we upgrade the server with
an object of the new class:
<<<
declare
class CComputeServer from ComputeServer
   meth run(P Prio<=medium)
      thread
         {Thread.setThisPriority Prio}
         ComputeServer,run(P)
      end
   end
end

Srv2={Upg CComputeServer#init}
>>>

<P>That's all there is to it.
The upgraded compute server overrides
the <<run>> method with a new
method that has a default.
The new method supports the original call <<run(P)>>
and adds a new call <<run(P Prio)>>, where <<Prio>>
sets the priority of the thread doing computation <<P>>.

<index/garbage collection<and>in a server/
<P>The compute server can be
upgraded indefinitely
since garbage collection will remove
any unused old compute server code.
For example, it would be nice if the client could
find out how many active computations there
are on the compute server
before deciding whether or not to do
a computation there.
We leave it to the reader to upgrade
the server to add a new
method that returns the number of
active computations at each priority level.

<SECTION id="practical.tips"><TITLE>Practical tips</TITLE>

<P>This section gives some practical programming tips to
improve the network performance of distributed applications:
timing and memory problems,
avoiding sending data that is not used at the destination
and avoiding sending classes when sending objects across
the network.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Timing and memory problems</TITLE>

<P>When the distribution structure of an application
is changed, then one must be careful not to cause
timing and memory problems.
<LIST>
<ITEM>When a reference <<X>> is exported from a site
(i.e., put in a message and sent) and
<<X>> refers directly or indirectly
to unused modules then the modules will be loaded into memory.
This is so even if they will never be used.

<ITEM>Relative timings between different parts of a program
depend on the distribution structure.
For example, unsynchronized producer/consumer threads
may work fine if both are on the same site: it suffices
to give the producer thread a slightly lower priority.
If the threads are on different sites, the producer
may run faster and cause a memory leak.

<ITEM>If the same record is sent repeatedly to a site,
then a new copy of the record will be created there each time.
This is true because records don't have global names.
The lack of global names
makes it faster to send records across the network.
</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Avoiding sending useless data</TITLE>

<P>When sending a procedure over the network, be sure
that it doesn't contain calculations that could have been done
on the original site.
For example, the following code sends the procedure <<P>>
to remote object <<D>>:
<<<
declare
R={MakeTuple big 100000}  % A very, very big tuple
proc {P X} X=R.2710 end   % Procedure that uses tuple field 2710
{D addentry(P)}           % Send P to D, where it is executed
>>>
<P>If <<D>> executes <<P>>, then the big tuple <<R>>
is transferred to <<D>>'s site,
where field number <<2710>> is extracted.
With 100,000 fields, this means 400KB is sent over the network!
Much better is to extract the field before sending <<P>>:
<<<
declare
R={MakeTuple big 100000}
F=R.2710                  % Extract field 2710 before sending
proc {P X} X=F end
{D addentry(P)}
>>>
<P>This avoids sending the tuple across the network.
This technique is a kind of partial evaluation.
It is useful for almost any Oz entity,
for example procedures, functions, classes, and functors.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Avoiding sending classes</TITLE>

<P>When sending an object across the network, it is
good to make sure that the object's class exists at
the destination site.
This avoids sending the class code across the network.
Let's see how this works in the case of a collaborative tool.
Two sites have identical binaries of this tool, which they
are running.  The two sites send objects back and forth.
Here's how to write the application:
<<<
declare
class C
   % ... lots of class code comes here
end
functor
define
   Obj={New C init}
   % ... code for the collaborative tool
end
>>>
<P>This creates the class <<C>> for the functor to
reference.
This means that all copies of the binary with this
functor will reference the <EM>same</EM> class,
so that an object arriving at a site will recognize
the <EM>same</EM> class as its class on the original site.

<P>Here's how <EM>not</EM> to write the application:
<<<
functor
define
   class C
      % ... lots of class code comes here
   end
   Obj={New C init}
   % ... code for the collaborative tool
end
>>>
<P>Do you see why?  Think first before
reading the next paragraph!
For a hint read <ptr to="stateless.entities">.

<P>In both solutions, the functor is applied when
the application starts up.
In the second solution,
this defines a new and different
class <<C>> on each site.
If an object of class <<C>> is passed to a site,
then the site will ask for the class code
to be passed too.
This can be very slow if the class is big--for TransDraw
it makes a difference of several minutes on a typical
Internet connection.
In the first solution, the class <<C>> is defined
<em>before</em> the functor is applied.
When the functor is applied, the class already exists!
This means that all sites have exactly the same class,
which is part of the binary on each site.
Objects passed between the sites will never cause
class code to be sent.
