  <TITLE>Basic Operations and Examples</TITLE>

<SECTION><TITLE>Global naming</TITLE>

<P>Global names are needed when an application
wants to interact with the world outside it.
Mozart supports three basic kinds of global names:
<LIST>
<ITEM> A <EM>ticket</EM> is a string that references a data
structure inside a running application.
Tickets are created by Mozart and
can be used to connect running applications together.
<ITEM> A <EM>URL</EM> is a string that references
a file across the network.
The string follows the standard URL syntax.
In Mozart the file can be a <EM>pickle</EM>, in which case
it can hold any kind of stateless data--procedures,
classes, functors, records, strings, etc.
<ITEM> A <EM>hostname</EM> is a string that
refers to a host (another machine) across the network.
The string follows the standard DNS syntax.
An application can use the hostname to start up another
Mozart process there.
</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Connecting applications by means of tickets</TITLE>

<P>Let's say Application 1 has a stream that
it wants others to access.
It can do this by creating a ticket
that references the stream.
The module <<Connection>> implements tickets.
Application 1 first creates a ticket for the stream
by using <<Connection>> as follows:

<<<
declare Stream Tkt in
{Connection.offer Stream Tkt}
{Show Tkt}
>>>

<P>Then Application 1 publishes the ticket somewhere so that
other applications can access it.
Our example displays
the ticket string in the emulator window.
We will use copy and paste to communicate the ticket
to another application.
The ticket looks something like
<<'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'>>.
Don't worry about exactly what's inside the ticket.
Users don't normally see tickets:
they are stored in files or passed across the network,
e.g., in mail messages.
Application 2 can use the ticket to get a reference
to the stream:

<<<
declare Stream in
{Connection.take 
   'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'
   Stream}
{Browse Stream}
>>>

<P>If Application 1 binds the stream
by doing <<Stream=a|b|c|_>>
then Application 2's browse window will show the bindings.

<P>The operation <<Connection.offer>> creates
a <EM>one-shot</EM> ticket, i.e., a ticket
that can be taken only once.
Within the module <<Connection>>,
a ticket that can be taken any
number of times can be defined
easily as follows:
<<<
declare
proc {Connection_many X ?Ticket ?Close}
   G={New Connection.gate init(X Ticket)}
in
   proc {Close} {G close} end
end
>>>
Given a reference <<X>>, <<Connection_many>>
defines a many-shot ticket <<Ticket>>
and a zero-argument procedure <<Close>>
that is used to close the ticket, i.e.,
to make the ticket invalid.
Attempting to take a ticket after a
close will raise an exception.


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Persistent data structures</TITLE>

<P>An application can save
any stateless data structure
in a file and load it again from a file.
The loading may be done from a URL, used as 
a file's global name.
The module <<Pickle>> implements the saving
and loading, and the conversion to and from
the file format.

<P>For example, let's define a function and save it:

<<<
declare
fun {Fact N}
   if N=<1 then 1 else N*{Fact N-1} end
end

{Pickle.save Fact "~pvr/public_html/fact"}
>>>

<P>Since the function is in a <<public_html>> directory,
anyone can load it by giving a URL that specifies
the file:

<<<
declare
Fact={Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/fact"}

{Browse {Fact 10}}
>>>

<P>Anything stateless can be saved in a pickle,
including functions, procedures, classes,
functors, records, and atoms.
Stateful entities, such as objects and variables,
cannot be pickled.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Remote computations</TITLE>

<P>An application can start a computation
on a given host that uses the resources
of that host and
that continues to interact with the
application.
The computation is specified as a functor,
which is the standard way to
define computations with the resources they need.

<P>First we create a new Mozart process
that is ready to accept new computations:
<<<
declare
R={New Remote.manager init(host:"sinuhe.sics.se")}
>>>

<P>Let's make the process do some work.
We define a functor that does the work
when we evaluate it:
<<<
declare F M
F=functor export x:X define X={Fact 30} end 

M={R apply(url:'./' F $)}

{Browse M.x}
>>>

<P>The answer is returned to the client site in the module <<M>>,
which should not reference any resources.
Module <<M>> is a record; the answer is at <<M.x>>.
If it does, an exception will be raised in the thread
doing the <<apply>>.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Remote computations and functors</TITLE>

<P>A better solution than the one given
in the previous section is for the functor itself
to install the compute server on the remote site.
This completely <EM>separates</EM> the distribution aspect
(setting up the remote site to do the right thing)
from the computation(s) that we want to do.
We give this solution later in the tutorial.

<P>Another solution is to use a functor with
an external reference:
<<<
declare F M X in
F=functor define {Fact 30 X} end

M={R apply(url:'./' F $)}
{Browse X}
>>>

<P>This functor is not stateless,
but it's all right since we are not pickling the functor.
In fact, it's quite possible for
functors to have external references.
We discuss this later when we
talk about computed functors.

<SECTION><TITLE>Servers</TITLE>

<P>A server is a long-lived computation that provides a service to clients.
We will show progressively how to build different kinds of servers.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>The hello server</TITLE>

<P>Let's build a basic server that returns the string <<"Hello world">>
to clients.
The first step is to create the server.
Let's do this and also make the server available through a URL:
<<<
% Create server
declare Str Prt Srv in
{NewPort Str Prt}
thread 
   {ForAll Str proc {$ S} S="Hello world" end}
end
proc {Srv X}
   {Send Prt X}
end

% Make server available through given URL:
{Pickle.save 
   {Connection_many Srv}
   "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/hw"}
>>>
<P>All the above must be executed on the server site.
Later on we will show how a client can create a
server remotely.

<P>Any client that knows the URL can access the server:
<<<
declare Srv in
Srv={Connection.take {Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/hw"}}

local X in
   {Srv X}
   {Browse X}
end
>>>
<P>This will show <<"Hello world">> in the browser window.

<P>What happens is that by taking the connection, the client
gets in its computation space a reference to the server.
This merges conceptually the client and server computation spaces
into a single computation space.
The client and server can then communicate as if
they were in the same process.
Later, when the client forgets the server reference,
the computation spaces become separate again.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Making stationary objects</TITLE>

<P>Stationary entities are a very important abstraction.
Mozart provides two primitive operations to
make entities stationary.
The first is creating a stationary object:
<<<
declare
Object={NewStat Class Init}
>>>
<P>When executed on a site,
the procedure <<NewStat>> takes a class and an initial message
and creates an object that is stationary on that site.
We define <<NewStat>> as follows:
<<<
declare
proc {NewStat Class Init Object}
   Object={MakeStat {New Class Init}}
end
>>>
<P>The procedure <<MakeStat>> takes an object or a one-argument
procedure and returns a one-argument procedure that
obeys exactly the same language semantics and is stationary.
We define <<{MakeStat PO StatP}>> as follows, where
<<PO>> is an object or a one-argument procedure
and <<StatP>> is a one-argument procedure:

<<<
declare
proc {MakeStat PO ?StatP}
   S P={NewPort S}
   N={NewName}
in
   proc {StatP M}
   R in
      {Send P M#R}
      if R==N then skip else raise R end end
   end
   thread
      {ForAll S
       proc {$ M#R}
          thread
             try {PO M} R=N catch X then R=X end
          end
       end}
   end
end
>>>

<P><<StatP>> preserves exactly the same language semantics
as <<PO>>.  That is, it has the same concurrency
behavior and it raises the same exceptions.
The new name <<N>> is a globally-unique token.
This ensures that
there is no conflict with any exceptions
raised by <<ProcOrObj>>.


<NOTE FOOT>One-argument procedures are not exactly
objects, since they do not have features.
For all practical purposes, though, one-argument
procedures and objects have identical calling patterns.</NOTE>


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>The hello server with stationary objects</TITLE>

<P>The previous section showed how to build a basic server
using a port to collect messages.
There is in fact a much cleaner way,
namely by using stationary objects.
Here's how to create the server:
<<<
declare
class HelloWorld
   meth hw(X) X="Hello world" end
end

Srv={NewStat HelloWorld hw(_)} % Requires an initial method
>>>
<P>The client calls the server
by doing <<{Srv hw(X)}>>.
The class <<HelloWorld>> can be replaced by any class.
The only difference between this and creating
a centralized object is that <<New>> is replaced by <<NewStat>>.
This specifies the distributed behavior of the object.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>A compute server</TITLE>

<P>One of the promises of distributed computing is making
computations go faster by exploiting the parallelism
inherent in networks of computers.
A first step is to create a compute server, that is,
a server that accepts any computation and uses
its computational resources to do the computation.
Here's one way to create a compute server:
<<<
declare
class ComputeServer
   meth init skip end
   meth run(P) {P} end
end

C={NewStat ComputeServer init}
>>>
<P>The compute server can be made available through a URL
as shown before.
Here's how a client uses the compute server:
<<<
declare
fun {Fibo N}
   if N<2 then 1 else {Fibo N-1}+{Fibo N-2} end
end

% Do first computation remotely
local F in
   {C run(proc {$} F={Fibo 30} end)}
   {Browse F}
end

% Do second computation locally
local F in
   F={Fibo 30}
   {Browse F}
end
>>>
<P>This first does the computation
remotely and then repeats it locally.
In the remote case, the variable <<F>>
is shared between the client and server.
When the server binds it, its value
is immediately sent to the server.
This is how the client gets a result from the server

<P>Any Oz expression <EM>E</EM> can be executed
remotely by prefixing it by
<<{C run(proc {$}>> and suffixing it by <<end)}>>.
Because Mozart is fully network-transparent,
<EM>E</EM> can be almost any expression
in the language: for example,
<EM>E</EM> can define new classes
inheriting from client classes.
The only expressions not allowed are
those using client resources.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>A compute server with functors</TITLE>

<P>The solution of the previous section
is reasonable when the client and server
are independent computations that connect.
Let's now see how the
client itself can start up a compute
server on a remote site.
The client first creates a new Mozart process:
<<<
declare
R={New Remote.manager init(host:"sinuhe.sics.se")}
>>>

<P>Then the client sends a functor
to this process that, when evaluated,
creates a compute server:
<<<
declare F C
F=functor 
  export cs:CS
  define 
     class ComputeServer
        meth init skip end
        meth run(P) {P} end
     end
     CS={NewStat ComputeServer init}
  end

C={R apply(url:'./' F $)}.cs  % Set up the compute server
>>>

<P>The client can use the compute server as before:
<<<
local F in
   {C run(proc {$} F={Fibo 30} end)}
   {Browse F}
end
>>>


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>A dynamically-extensible server</TITLE>

<P>Sometimes a server has to be upgraded,
for example
to add extra functionality or to fix a bug.
We show how to upgrade a server
without stopping it.
This cannot be done in Java.
In practice, the upgrade can even
be done interactively.
A person sits down at a terminal anywhere
in the world, starts up an interactive Mozart
session, and upgrades the server while it is running.

<P>Let's first define a generic upgradable server:
<<<
declare
proc {NewUpgradableStat Class Init ?Upg ?Srv}
   Obj={New Class Init}
   C={NewCell Obj}
in
   Srv={MakeStat 
          proc {$ M} {{Access C} M} end}
   Upg={MakeStat
          proc {$ Class2#Init2} {Assign C {New Class2 Init2}} end}
end
>>>
<P>This definition must be executed 
on the server site.
It returns a server <<Srv>> and a stationary procedure
<<Upg>> used for upgrading the server.
The server is upgradable because it does
all object calls indirectly through the cell <<C>>.

<P>A client creates an upgradable compute server almost
exactly as it creates a fixed compute server,
by executing the following on the server site:
<<<
declare Srv Upg in
Srv={NewUpgradableStat ComputeServer init Upg}
>>>
<P>Let's now upgrade the compute server while
it is running.
We first define a new class <<CComputeServer>>
and then we upgrade the server with
an object of the new class:
<<<
declare
class CComputeServer from ComputeServer
   meth run(P Prio<=medium)
      thread
         {Thread.setThisPriority Prio}
         ComputeServer,run(P)
      end
   end
end

Srv2={Upg CComputeServer#init}
>>>

<P>That's all there is to it.
The upgraded compute server overrides
the <<run>> method with a new
method that has a default.
The new method supports the original call <<run(P)>>
and adds a new call <<run(P Prio)>>, where <<Prio>>
sets the priority of the thread doing computation <<P>>.

<P>The compute server can be
upgraded indefinitely
since garbage collection will remove
any unused old compute server code.
For example, it would be nice if the client could
find out how many active computations there
are on the compute server
before deciding whether or not to do
a computation there.
We leave it to the reader to upgrade
the server to add a new
method that returns the number of
active computations at each priority level.
