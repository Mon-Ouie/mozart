  <TITLE>Distribution Model</TITLE>

<P>The basic difference between a distributed and
a centralized program is that the former
is partitioned among several sites.
<index id=idx.site/site<and>definition/
<index/geographic distribution/
We define a <EM>site</EM>
as the basic unit of geographic distribution.
In the current implementation,
a site is always one
<index id=idx.process/process/
operating system process on one machine.
<index id=idx.multitasking/multitasking/
<index id=idx.sitemultitasking/site<and>multitasking/
A multitasking system can host several sites.
An Oz language entity has the same
<index id=idx.languagesemantics/language semantics/
<index id=idx.semanticslanguage/semantics<and>language/
<index see=idx.languagesemantics/centralized semantics/
language semantics whether it is used on only one site
or on several sites.
We say that Mozart is
<index id=idx.networktransparent/network-transparent/
<EM>network-transparent</EM>.
If used on several sites, the language entity
is implemented using a distributed protocol.
This gives the language entity a particular
distributed semantics in terms of network messages.

<P>The <EM>distributed semantics</EM>
<index id=idx.distributedsemantics/distributed semantics<and>definition/
<index id=idx.semanticsdistributed/semantics<and>distributed/
defines the network communications done by the system
when operations are performed on an entity.
The distributed semantics of the entities
depends on their type.
The distribution model gives well-defined distributed
semantics to all Oz language entities.

<P>The distributed semantics has been carefully
designed to give the programmer full control
over network communication patterns where it matters.
The distributed semantics does the
right thing by default in almost all cases.
For example, procedure code is transferred to sites
immediately, so that sites never need ask for
procedure code.
For objects, the developer can
specify the desired distributed semantics, e.g.,
mobile (cached) objects, stationary objects,
and stationary single-threaded objects.
<ptr to="language.entities"> defines the distributed semantics for each
type of language entity,
<ptr to="sites"> explains more about what happens at sites,
and <ptr to="bringing"> outlines
how to build distributed applications.

<SECTION id="language.entities"><TITLE>Language entities</TITLE>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Objects</TITLE>

<P>The most critical entities
in terms of network efficiency are the objects.
Objects have a state that has to be updated in a
globally-consistent way.
The efficiency of this operation depends
on the object's distributed semantics.
Many distributed semantics are possible,
providing a range of trade-offs for the developer.
Here are some of the more useful ones:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <EM>Cached object</EM>:
<index id=idx.cachedobject/cached object/
<index id=idx.objectcached/object<and>cached/
<index/object<and>mobile/
<index/mobile object/
Objects and cells are cached by default--we also call
this "mobile objects".
Objects are always executed locally,
in the thread that invokes the method.
This means that
a site attempting to execute a method will first fetch the object,
which requires up to three network messages.
After this, no further messages are needed as long
as the object stays on the site.
The object will not move as long as execution
stays within a method.
If many sites use the object, then it will travel
among the sites, giving everyone a fair share of the object use.

<P>The site where the object is created
is called its
<index/owner site/
<index/site<and>owner/
<EM>owner site</EM>.
A reference to an object on its owner site
is called an <EM>owner</EM> or <EM>owner node</EM>.
All other sites referencing the object are
<index id=idx.proxysite/proxy site/
<index id=idx.siteproxy/site<and>proxy/
<EM>proxy sites</EM>.
A remote reference to an object is
called a <EM>proxy</EM> or a <EM>proxy node</EM>.
A site requesting the object
first sends a message to the owner site.
The owner site then
sends a forwarding request to the site currently
hosting the object.
This hosting site then sends the object's
state pointer to the requesting site.

<P>The class of a cached object is copied to each
site that calls the object.
<index id=lazyclass/lazy<and>class/
This is done lazily, i.e., the class is only
copied when the object is called for the first time.
Once the class is on the site, no further copies are done.

<ITEM> <EM>Stationary object (server)</EM>:
<index id=stationaryobject/stationary object<and>definition/
<index/object<and>stationary/
A stationary object remains on the site at which it was created.
Each method invocation uses one message to start the method
and one message to synchronize with the caller
when the method is finished.
<index id=threadlightweight/thread<and>lightweight/
<index id=lightweightthread/lightweight thread/
Exceptions are raised in the caller's thread.
Each method executes in a new thread created
for it on the object's site.
This is reasonable
since threads in Mozart are extremely lightweight
(millions can be created on one machine).

<ITEM> <EM>Sequential asynchronous stationary object</EM>:
<index id=sasoobject/object<and>sequential asynchronous stationary/
In this object,
each method invocation uses one message only and does not
wait until the method is finished.
All method invocations execute in the same thread,
so the object is executed in a completely sequential way.
Non-caught exceptions in a method are ignored by the caller.
</LIST>
<P>Deciding between these three behaviors is done
when the object is created from its class.
A cached object is created with <<New>>,
a stationary object is created with <<NewStat>>,
and an sequential asynchronous stationary object
is created with <<NewSASO>>.
A stationary object is a good abstraction to
build servers (see <ptr to="making.stationary.objects">)
and fault-tolerant servers.
<!--  (see <ptr to="fault.tolerant.stationary.objects">). -->
It is easy to program other distribution
semantics in Oz.
<ptr to="chapter.examples"> gives some examples.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Other stateful entities</TITLE>

<P>The other stateful language entities have the following
distributed semantics:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <EM>Thread</EM>:
<index id=idx.thread/thread/
A thread actively executes a sequence of instructions.
The thread is stationary on the site it is created.
Threads communicate through shared data and
block when the data is unavailable, i.e.,
when trying to access unbound logic variables.
<index id=idx.dataflow/data-flow/
This makes Oz a data-flow language.
Threads are <EM>sited</EM> entities (see <ptr to="sited.entities">).

<ITEM> <EM>Port</EM>:
<index id=idx.port/port/
<index id=idx.channel/channel<and>port (asynchronous many-to-one)/
<index id=idx.amtochannel/asynchronous many-to-one channel/
A port is an asynchronous many-to-one channel
that respects FIFO for messages sent from within the same thread.
A port is stationary on the site it is created,
which is called its <EM>owner site</EM>.
The messages are appended to a stream
on the port's site.
Messages from the same thread appear
in the stream in the same order
in which they were sent in the thread.
A port's stream is terminated by a
<em>future</em> (see <ptr to="single.assignment">).

<P>Sending to a local port is always asynchronous.
Sending to a remote port is asynchronous except if
all available memory in the network layer is in use.
In that case, the send blocks.
The network layer frees memory after sending data across the network.
When enough memory is freed, the send is continued.
This provides an end-to-end flow control.

<P>Oz ports, which are a language concept,
should not be confused with
<index id=idx.portunixoz/port<and>Oz vs. Unix/
<index id=idx.unixport/Unix port/
Unix ports, which are an OS concept.
Mozart applications do not need to use Unix ports explicitly
except to communicate with applications
that have a Unix port interface.

<ITEM> <EM>Cell</EM>:
A cell is an updatable pointer to any other entity,
i.e., it is analogous to a standard updatable variable
in imperative languages such as C and Java.
<index/cell<and>analogy to C and Java/
<index/Java language<and>relation to Oz cell/
<index/C language<and>relation to Oz cell/
Cells have the same distributed semantics
as cached objects.
Updating the pointer
may need up to three network messages,
but once the cell is local, then further
updates do not use the network any more.

<ITEM> <EM>Thread-reentrant lock</EM>:
<index id=idx.threadreentrant/thread<and>reentrant lock/
<index id=idx.threadreentrantlock/thread-reentrant lock/
<index id=idx.lockthread/lock<and>thread-reentrant/
A thread-reentrant lock allows only a single
thread to enter a given program region.
Locks can be created dynamically
and nested recursively.
Locks have the same distributed semantics
as cached objects and cells.
This implements a standard distributed mutual
exclusion algorithm.
</LIST>

<SUBSECTION id="single.assignment"><TITLE>Single-assignment entities</TITLE>

<P>An important category of language entities
are those that can be assigned only to one value:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <EM>Logic variable</EM>:
<index/logic variable/
<index/variable<and>logic variable/
Logic variables have two operations:
they can be bound (i.e., assigned)
or read (i.e., wait until bound).
A logic variable resembles a single-assignment variable,
<index id=idx.variablefinal/variable<and><<final>> in Java/
e.g., a <<final>> variable in Java.
It is more than that because two logic variables can
be bound together even before they are assigned,
and because a variable can be assigned more than
once, if always to the same value.
Logic variables are important for three reasons:
<LIST>
<ITEM> They have a more efficient protocol than cells.
Often, variables are used as placeholders, that is,
they will be assigned only once.
It would be highly inefficient in a distributed system
to create a cell for that case.
<P>When a logic variable is bound,
the value is sent to its <EM>owner site</EM>,
namely the site on which it was created.
The owner site then
<index id=idx.multicast/multicast/
multicasts the value to all the
proxy sites, namely the sites that have the variable.
The current release implements
the multicast as a sequence of message sends.
That is, if the variable is on <EM>n</EM> sites,
then a maximum of <EM>n</EM>+1 messages are
needed to bind the variable.
When a variable arrives on a site
for the first time, it is immediately
registered with the owner site.
This takes one message.
<ITEM> They can be used to improve
<index id=idx.latencytolerance/latency tolerance/
latency tolerance.
A logic variable can be passed in a message
or stored in a data structure
before it is assigned a value.
When the value is there, then
it is sent to all sites that need it.
<ITEM> They are the basic mechanism
for synchronization and communication
in concurrent execution.
Data-flow execution in Oz is implemented
with logic variables.
Oz does not need an explicit
monitor or signal concept--rather,
logic variables let threads
wait until data is available,
<index id=idx.dataavailability/thread<and>data availability/
<index/concurrency<and>90% rule/
which is 90% of the needs of concurrency.
A further 9% is provided by reentrant locking,
which is implemented by logic variables and cells.
The remaining 1% are not so simply
handled by these two cases and must be
programmed explicitly.
The reader is advised not to take
the above numbers too seriously.
</LIST>

<ITEM> <EM>Future</EM>:
<index/future/
<index/logic variable<and>read-only (future)/
A future is a read-only logic variable,
i.e., it can only be <em>read</em>, not bound.
Attempting to bind a future will block.
A future can be created explicitly from a logic variable.
Futures are useful to protect logic variables from being
bound by unauthorized sites.
Futures are also used to distribute constrained variables
(see <ptr to="sited.entities">).

<ITEM> <EM>Stream</EM>:
<index id=idx.stream/stream/
A stream is an asynchronous one-to-many communication channel.
In fact,
a stream is just a list whose last element is a logic variable
or a future.
If the stream is bound on the owner site,
then the binding is sent asynchronously to all sites that
have the variable.
Bindings from the same thread appear
in the stream in the same order
that they occur in the thread.

<P>A port together with a stream efficiently implement an
asynchronous many-to-many channel
that respects the order of messages
sent from the same thread.
No order is enforced between
messages from different threads.

</LIST>

<SUBSECTION id="stateless.entities"><TITLE>Stateless entities</TITLE>

<P>Stateless entities never
change, i.e., they do not have any internal state whatsoever.
Their distributed semantics is very efficient:
they are copied across the net in a single message.
The different kinds of stateless entities differ
in when the copy is done (eager or lazy)
and in how many copies of the entity
can exist on a site:
<LIST>

<ITEM> <EM>Records and numbers</EM>:
<index id=idx.distributedsemanticsrecord/distributed semantics<and>record/
<index id=idx.record/record/
<index id=idx.distributedsemanticsnumber/distributed semantics<and>number/
<index id=idx.number/number/
<index id=idx.distributedsemanticslist/distributed semantics<and>list/
<index id=idx.list/list/
<index id=idx.distributedsemanticsstring/distributed semantics<and>string/
<index id=idx.string/string/
This includes lists and strings, which
are just particular kinds of records.
Records and numbers are copied eagerly across the network,
in the message that references them.
The same record and number may occur many
times on a site, once per copy
(remember that integers in Mozart
may have any number of digits).
Since these entities are so very basic
and primitive, it would be highly inefficient
to manage remote references to them
and to ensure that they exist only once on a site.
Of course, records and lists may refer
to any other kind of entity,
and the distributed semantics of that
entity depends on its type, not on
the fact of its being inside a record
or a list.

<ITEM> <EM>Procedures, functions, classes, functors,
chunks, atoms, and names</EM>:
<index/distributed semantics<and>procedure/
<index/procedure/
<index/distributed semantics<and>function/
<index/function/
<index/distributed semantics<and>class/
<index/class/
<index/distributed semantics<and>functor/
<index/functor/
<index/distributed semantics<and>chunk/
<index/chunk/
<index/distributed semantics<and>atom/
<index/atom/
<index/distributed semantics<and>name/
<index/name/
These entities are copied eagerly across the
network, but can only exist once on a given site.
For example, an object's class contains the code
of all the object's methods.
If many objects of a given class
exist on a site,
then the class only exists there once.

<P>Each instance of all the above (except atoms) is globally unique.
For example, if the same source-code
definition of a procedure is run more than once, then it will
create a different procedure each time around.
This is part of the Oz language semantics;
one way to think of it is that a new Oz name is created
for every procedure instance.
This is true for functions, classes, functors,
chunks, and of course for names too.
It is not true for atoms; two atoms with the
same print name are identical, even if created separately.

<ITEM> <EM>Object-records</EM>:
<index/distributed semantics<and>object-record/
<index/distributed semantics<and>object/
<index/record<and>object-record/
<index/object<and>object-record/
An object is a composite entity consisting
of an object-record that references
the object's features, a cell, and an internal class.
The distribution semantics
of the object's internal class
are different from
that of a class that is referenced explicitly
independent of any object.
An object-record and an internal class are both chunks
that are copied lazily.
I.e., if an object is passed to a site,
then when the object is called there,
the object-record is requested if it is missing
and the class is requested if it is missing.
If the internal class already exists
on the site, then it is not requested at all.
On the other hand,
a class that referenced explicitly is passed eagerly,
i.e., a message referencing the class
will contain the class code,
even if the site already has a copy.

</LIST>
<P>In terms of the language semantics,
there are only two different stateless language
entities: procedures and records.
All other entities are derived.
Functions are syntactic sugar for procedures.
Chunks are a particular kind of record.
Classes are chunks that contain object methods,
which are themselves procedures.
Functors are chunks that contain a function
taking modules as arguments and returning a module,
where a module is a record.

<SUBSECTION id="sited.entities"><TITLE>Sited entities</TITLE>

<P>Entities that can be used only on one site
are called <EM>sited</EM>.
<index/sited entity<and>definition/
<index/language entity<and>sited/
<index/owner site/
<index/home site/
We call this site their <EM>owner site</EM>
or <EM>home site</EM>.
References to these entities can be passed to other
sites, but they do not work there
(an exception will be raised if an operation is attempted).
They work only on their owner site.
Entities that can be used on any site
<index/unsited entity/
<index/language entity<and>unsited/
are called <EM>unsited</EM>.
Because of network transparency,
unsited entities have the same language semantics
independent of where they are used.

<P>In Mozart, all sited entities are modules,
except for a few exceptional cases listed below.
Not all modules are sited, though.
<index/module<and>definition/
<index/language entity<and>module/
<index/record<and>module/
A <EM>module</EM> is a record that
groups related operations and
that possibly has some internal state.
The modules that are available in a Mozart
<index/base module/
<index/module<and>base<and>definition/
process when it starts up are called <EM>base modules</EM>.
The base modules contain all operations on
all basic Oz types.
<index/system module/
<index/module<and>system<and>definition/
There are additional modules, called <EM>system modules</EM>,
that are part of the system but loaded only when needed.
Furthermore, an application can define more
modules by means of functors that are
imported from other modules.
A <em>functor</em> is a module specification
that makes explicit the resources needed
by the module.

<P>All base modules are unsited.
For example, a procedure that does additions
can be used on another site,
since the addition operation is
<index/module<and>base<and><<Number>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Int>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Float>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Record>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<List>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Procedure>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Port>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Cell>>/
<index/module<and>base<and><<Lock>>/
part of the base module <<Number>>.
Some commonly-used base modules are
<<Number>>, <<Int>>, and <<Float>> (operations on numbers),
<<Record>> and <<List>> (operations on records and lists),
and
<<Procedure>>, <<Port>>, <<Cell>>, and <<Lock>>
(operations on common entities).

<P>Due to limitations of the current release,
<index/sited entity<and>thread/
<index/thread<and>sited entity/
<index/sited entity<and>dictionary/
<index/dictionary<and>sited entity/
<index/sited entity<and>array/

<index/space<and>sited entity/
<index/distributed semantics<and>dictionary/
<index/distributed semantics<and>thread/
<index/distributed semantics<and>array/
<index/distributed semantics<and>space/
threads, dictionaries, arrays, and spaces are sited
even though they are in base modules.
These entities will become
unsited in future releases.

<P>When a reference to a constrained variable
<index/constrained variable/
<index/logic variable<and>constrained variable/
<index/logic variable<and>constrained/
<index/finite domain variable/
<index/logic variable<and>finite domain/
<index/finite set variable/
<index/logic variable<and>free record/
<index/free record variable/
(finite domain, finite set, or free record)
is passed to another site, then this reference
<index/future/
<index/logic variable<and>read-only (future)/
is converted to a <em>future</em>
(see <ptr to="single.assignment">).
The future will be bound when the constrained
variable becomes determined.

<index/resource/
<index/sited entity<and>resource/
<P>We call <EM>resource</EM> any module
that is either a system module
or that imports directly or
indirectly from a system module.
All resources are sited.
The reason is that
they contain state outside of the Oz language.
This state is either part of the emulator or
external to the Mozart process.
Access to this state
is limited to the machine hosting
the Mozart process.
Some commonly-used system modules are
<index/module<and>system<and><<Tk>>/
<index/module<and>system<and><<Browser>>/
<index/module<and>system<and><<Connection>>/
<index/module<and>system<and><<Remote>>/

<<Search>> and <<FD>> (constraint programming),
<<Open>> and <<Pickle>> (the file system),
<<OS>> and <<Property>> (the OS and emulator),
and so forth.

<SECTION id="sites"><TITLE>Sites</TITLE>

<SUBSECTION id="section.distmodel.shutdown"><TITLE>Controlled system shutdown</TITLE>

<P>A site can be stopped in two ways: normally or abnormally.
<index id=normal.shutdown/shutdown<and>normal/
<index see=normal.shutdown/halt<and>normal/
The normal way is a controlled shutdown initiated
by <<{Application.exit I}>>, where <<I>> is
the return status (see the module <<Application>>).
<index id=abnormal.shutdown/shutdown<and>abnormal/
<index see=abnormal.shutdown/halt<and>abnormal/
The abnormal way is a site crash
triggered by an external problem.
The failure model (see <ptr to="chapter.failure">) is used
to survive site crashes.
Here we explain what a controlled shutdown means
in the distribution model.

<P>All language entities, except for stateless entities
that are copied immediately, have an owner site and proxy sites.
The owner site is always the site on which the entity was created.
A controlled shutdown has no adverse effect on any
distributed entity whose owner is on another site.
This is enforced by the distributed protocols.
For example, if a cell's state pointer is on
the shutting-down site, then the state pointer is
moved to the owner site before shutting down.
If the owner node is on the shutting-down site,
then that entity will no longer work.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Distributed memory management</TITLE>

<P>All memory management in Mozart is automatic;
the programmer does not have to worry about when
an entity is no longer referenced.
<index/garbage collection<and>distributed/
<index/memory management/
Mozart implements an efficient distributed garbage collection
algorithm that reclaims all unused entities
except those that form a
<index/cycle/
<index/cross-site cycle/
cycle of references that exists
on at least two different owner sites.
For example, if two sites each own an object
that references the other, then they will
not be reclaimed.
If the objects are both owned by the same site,
then they will be reclaimed.

<P>This means that the programmer must be
somewhat careful when an application references
an entity on another site.   For example,
let's say a client references a server and
vice versa.  If the client wishes to disconnect
from the server, then it is sufficient that the
server forget all references to the client.
This will ensure there are no cross-site cycles.

<SECTION id="bringing"><TITLE>Bringing it all together</TITLE>

<index/application<and>overall structure/
<index/feeling<and>warm, fuzzy/
<P>Does the Mozart distribution model
give programmers a warm, fuzzy feeling when
writing distributed applications?
In short, yes it does.
The distribution model has been designed in tandem
with many application prototypes and numerous
Gedankenexperimenten.
We are confident that it is basically correct.

<P>Developing an application is separated into
two independent parts.
First, the application is written without
explicitly partitioning the computation among sites.
One can in fact check the correctness
and termination properties of the
application by running it on one site.

<P>Second, the objects are given distributed semantics
to satisfy the geographic constraints
(placement of resources, dependencies between sites)
and the performance constraints
(network bandwidth and latency, machine memory and speed).
The large-scale structure
of an application consists of a graph
of threads and objects, which access resources.
Threads are created initially and during
execution to ensure that each site does
the desired part of the execution.
Objects exchange messages,
which may refer to objects
or other entities.
Records and procedures,
both stateless entities,
are the basic data structures
of the application--they are
passed between sites when needed.
Logic variables and locks are
used to manage concurrency and data-flow execution.
See <ptr to="practical.tips"> for more
information on how to organize an application.

<P>Functors and resources are the key players
<index/component-based programming/
<index/programming<and>component-based/
in distributed component-based programming.
A functor specifies a software component.
A functor is stateless, so it can be transparently copied
anywhere across the net and made persistent by pickling on a file
(see the module <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.pickle"
/<<Pickle>>/).
A functor is linked on a site by evaluating it there
with the site resources that it needs
(see the modules <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.module"
/<<Module>>/ and <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.remote"
/<<Remote>>/).
The result is a new resource, which can be
used as is or to link more functors.
Our goal is for functors to be the core
technology driving an open community of developers,
who contribute to a growing global pool
of useful components.
