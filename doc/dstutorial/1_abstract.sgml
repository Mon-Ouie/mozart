This tutorial shows how to write efficient and robust distributed
applications with the Mozart platform.
We first present and motivate the distributed programming model and
the basic primitives needed for building distributed applications.
Then we progressively introduce
examples of distributed applications
to illustrate servers,
agents, mobility, collaborative tools,
and fault tolerance.
