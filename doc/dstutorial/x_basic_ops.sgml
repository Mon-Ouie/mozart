  <TITLE>Basic Operations</TITLE>

<SECTION><TITLE>Distribution model</TITLE>

<P> The distribution model gives well-defined distribution
behaviors to the Oz language entities.
The distribution behaviors are designed to do the
right thing by default in almost all cases.
For example, procedure code is transferred to sites
immediately, so that sites never need ask for
procedure code.
In the other cases, e.g., for objects, the developer can
specify the desired distribution behavior, e.g.,
mobile (cached) objects, stationary objects,
stationary single-threaded objects.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Objects</TITLE>

<P> The most critical entities in a distributed application
in terms of network efficiency are the objects.
Objects have a state that has to be updated in a
globally consistent way.
The efficiency of this operation depends
on the object's distributed behavior.
Many distribution behaviors are possible,
providing a range of trade-offs for the developer.
Here are some of the more useful ones:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <EM>Cached object</EM>:
Objects and cells are cached by default--we also call
this "mobile objects".
A site attempting to execute a method will first fetch the object,
which requires up to three network messages.
After this, no further messages are needed as long
as the object stays on the site.
If many sites use the object, then it will travel
among the sites, giving everyone a fair share of the object use.
Object execution is always in the thread that invoked
the method.

<P>The class of a cached object is copied to each
site that calls the object.
This is done lazily, i.e., the class is only
copied when the object is called for the first time.
Once the class is on the site, no further copies are done.

<ITEM> <EM>Stationary object (server)</EM>:
A stationary object remains on the site at which it was created.
Each method invocation uses one message to start the method
and one message to synchronize with the caller
when the method is finished.
Exceptions are raised in the caller's thread.
Each method executes in a new thread created
for it on the object's site.
This is reasonable
since threads in Mozart are extremely lightweight
(millions can be created on one machine).

<ITEM> <EM>Sequential asynchronous stationary object</EM>:
In this object,
each method invocation uses one message only and does not
wait until the method is finished.
All method invocations execute in the same thread,
so the object is executed in a completely sequential way.
Non-caught exceptions in a method are ignored by the caller.
</LIST>
<P> Deciding between these three behaviors is done
when the object is created from its class.
A cached object is created with <<New>>,
a stationary object is created with <<NewStat>>,
and an sequential asynchronous stationary object
is created with <<NewSASO>>.
A stationary object is a good abstraction to
build servers--this is explained later in
the tutorial.
It is easy to program other distribution
behaviors in Oz.
We give examples of some of them
later in the tutorial.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Other stateful entities</TITLE>

<P> The other stateful language entities have the following
distribution behaviors:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <EM>Thread</EM>:
A thread actively executes a sequence of instructions.
The thread is stationary on the site it is created.
Threads communicate through shared data and
block when the data is unavailable, i.e.,
when trying to access unbound logic variables.
This makes Oz a dataflow language.
Threads are <EM>sited</EM> entities,
as is explained later in the tutorial.

<ITEM> <EM>Port</EM>:
A port is an asynchronous many-to-one channel
that respects FIFO for messages sent from within the same thread.
A port is stationary on the site it is created.
The messages are appended to a stream
on the port's site.
Messages from the same thread appear
in the stream in the same order
in which they were sent in the thread.

<ITEM> <EM>Cell</EM>:
A cell is an updatable pointer to any other entity,
i.e., it is analogous to a standard updatable variable
in imperative languages such as C and Java.
Cells have the same distribution behavior
as cached objects.
Updating the pointer
may need up to three network messages,
but once the cell is local, then further
updates do not use the network any more.

<ITEM> <EM>Thread-reentrant lock</EM>:
A thread-reentrant lock allows only a single
thread to enter a given program region.
The locks can be created dynamically
and nested recursively.
The locks have the same distribution behavior
as cached objects and cells.
This implements a standard distributed mutual
exclusion algorithm.
</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Single-assignment entities</TITLE>

<P> An important category of language entities
are those that can be assigned only to one value:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <EM>Logic variable</EM>:
A logic variable resembles a single-assignment variable,
e.g., a <<final>> variable in Java.
It is more than that because two logic variables can
be bound together even before they are assigned,
and because a variable can be assigned more than
once, if it is always to the same value.
Logic variables are important for three reasons:
<LIST>
<ITEM> They have a more efficient protocol than cells.
Often, variables are just used like placeholders, that is,
they will be assigned only once.
It would be highly inefficient in a distributed system
to create a cell for that case.
<P> When a logic variable is bound,
the value is sent to its owner site
(the site on which it was created),
which then multicasts it to all the
sites that have the variable.
The current release implements
the multicast as a sequence of message sends.
That is, if the variable is on <EM>n</EM> sites,
then a maximum of <EM>n</EM>+1 messages are
used to bind the variable.
When a variable arrives on a site
for the first time, it is immediately
registered with the owner site.
This takes one message.
<ITEM> They can be used to improve latency tolerance.
A logic variable can be passed in a message
or stored in a data structure
before it is assigned a value.
When the value is there, then
it is sent to all sites that need it.
<ITEM> They are the basic mechanism
for synchronization and communication
in the concurrent execution.
Mozart does not need an explicit
monitor or signal concept--rather,
logic variables let programs
wait for data availability,
which is 90% of the needs of concurrency,
and 9% more is provided by reentrant locking,
which is implemented by logic variables and cells.
The remaining 1% are not so simply
handled by these two cases and must be
programmed explicitly.
The reader is advised not to take
the above numbers too seriously.
</LIST>

<ITEM> <EM>Stream</EM>:
A stream is an asynchronous one-to-many communication channel.
In fact,
a stream is just a list whose last element is a logic variable.
If the stream is bound on the owner site,
then the binding is sent asynchronously to all sites that
have the variable.
Messages from the same thread appear
in the stream in the same order
in which they were sent in the thread.

<P>A port together with a stream implement an
asynchronous many-to-many channel
that respects the order of messages
sent from the same thread.

</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Stateless entities</TITLE>

<P> Stateless entities never
change, i.e., they do not have any internal state whatsoever.
Their distribution behavior is very efficient:
they are copied across the net in a single message.
The different kinds of stateless entities differ
in when the copy is done (eager or lazy)
and in how many copies of the entity
can exist on a site:
<LIST>

<ITEM> <EM>Records, lists, and numbers</EM>:
These entities are copied eagerly across the network,
in the message that references them.
The same record, list, and number may occur many
times on a site, once per copy
(remember that integers in Mozart
may have any number of digits).
Since these entities are so very basic
and primitive, it would be highly inefficient
to manage remote references to them
and to ensure that they exist only once on a site.
Of course, records and lists may refer
to any other kind of entity,
and the distribution behavior of that
entity depends on its type, not on
the fact of its being inside a record
or a list.

<ITEM> <EM>Procedures, functions, classes, functors,
atoms, and names</EM>:
These entities are copied eagerly across the
network, but can only exist once on a given site.
For example, an object class contains the code
of all the object's methods.
If many objects of a given class
exist on a site, then the class only exists once.

<P> Note that classes are copied eagerly,
whereas objects are lazy.
I.e., if an object is passed to a site,
then the object's class is not copied to
the site until the object is called.
However, if a class is passed to a site,
then it is copied eagerly.

<ITEM> <EM>Chunks</EM>:
A chunk is a lazy record.
If a chunk is passed to a site,
then the site initially only
has a reference to the chunk.
The chunk is copied only when a thread
on the site tries to access one of
the chunk's fields.
Chunks exist to make it easy to introduce
laziness into large data structures when needed.

</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Sited entities</TITLE>

<P> Entities that can be used only on one site
are called <EM>sited</EM>.
References to these entities can be passed to other
sites, but they do not work there.
They work only on their home site.

<P> In Mozart, a module is a chunk that
encapsulates related operations and
that possibly has some internal state.
The modules that are available in a Mozart
process when it starts up are called system modules.

<P> System modules can be either sited or unsited.
A sited system module is called a <EM>resource</EM>.
A system module is sited if it refers to
anything whose access is considered limited
to the machine hosting the Mozart process.
Most system modules are sited, including
<<Tk>> and <<Browser>> (access to system graphics),
<<Connection>> and <<Remote>> (access to site-specific distributed operations),
<<Application>> and <<Module>> (access to application management),
<<Search>> and <<FD>> (access to constraint programming),
<<Open>> and <<Pickle>> (access to the file system),
<<OS>> and <<Property>> (access to the OS and emulator),
and so forth.

<P> A few system modules are unsited, namely those containing
basic system built-in operations (see Standard Modules).
For example, a procedure that does additions
can be copied to another site,
whereas a procedure that accesses <<Tk>> cannot.

<P> There are a few other entities that are sited
due to limitations of the current release.
For example, threads, dictionaries, arrays, and spaces are sited.
In the current release, any entity
that has state and that could
be implemented as an object is sited.
Many of these entities will become
unsited in future releases.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Bringing it all together</TITLE>

<P> Does the above classification
give programmers a warm, fuzzy feeling when
writing distributed applications?
In short, yes it does.
The distribution model has been designed in tandem
with many application prototypes and incredible
numbers of Gedankenexperimenten.

<P> Here's how to use the distribution model
to build applications.
Typically, the large-scale structure
of an application consists of a graph
of threads and objects, which access resources.
The objects are given distribution behaviors
to satisfy the geographic constraints
(placement of resources, dependencies between sites)
and
the performance constraints
(network bandwidth, machine memory and speed).
Threads are created initially and during
execution to ensure that each site does
the desired part of the execution.
Objects exchange messages,
which may refer to objects
or other entities.
Records and procedures,
both stateless entities,
are the basic data structures
of the application--they are
passed between sites when needed.
Logic variables and locks are
used to manage the dataflow and the concurrency.

<SECTION><TITLE>Global naming</TITLE>

<P> Global names are needed when an application
wants to interact with the world outside it.
Mozart supports three basic kinds of global names:
<LIST>
<ITEM> A <EM>ticket</EM> is a string that references a data
structure inside a running application.
Tickets are created by Mozart and
can be used to connect running applications together.
<ITEM> A <EM>URL</EM> is a string that references
a file across the network.
The string follows the standard URL syntax.
In Mozart the file can be a <EM>pickle</EM>, in which case
it can hold any kind of stateless data--procedures,
classes, records, strings, etc.
<ITEM> A <EM>hostname</EM> is a string that
refers to a host (another machine) across the network.
The string follows the standard DNS syntax.
An application can use the hostname to start up another
Mozart process there.
</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Connecting applications with tickets</TITLE>

<P> Let's say Application 1 has a stream that
it wants others to access.
It can do this by creating a ticket
that references the stream.
The module <<Connection>> implements tickets.
Application 1 first creates a ticket for the stream
by using <<Connection>> as follows:

<<<
declare Stream Tkt in
{Connection.offer Stream Tkt}
{Show Tkt}
>>>

<P> Then Application 1 publishes the ticket somewhere so that
other applications can access it.
Our example displays
the ticket string in the emulator window.
We will use copy and paste to communicate the ticket
to another application.
The ticket looks something like
<<'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'>>.
Don't worry about exactly what's inside the ticket.
Users don't normally see tickets:
they are stored in files or passed across the network,
e.g., in mail messages.
Application 2 can use the ticket to get a reference
to the stream:

<<<
declare Stream in
{Connection.take
   'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'
   Stream}
{Browse Stream}
>>>

<P> If Application 1 binds the stream
by doing <<Stream=a|b|c|_>>
then Application 2's browse window will show the bindings.


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Persistent data structures</TITLE>

<P> An application can save
any stateless data structure
in a file and load it again from a file.
The loading may be done from a URL, used as
a file's global name.
The module <<Pickle>> implements the saving
and loading, and the conversion to and from
the file format.

<P> For example, let's define a function and save it:

<<<
declare
fun {Fact N}
   if N=<1 then 1 else X*{Fact N-1} end
end

{Pickle.save Fact "~pvr/public_html/fact"}
>>>

<P> Since the function is in a <<public_html>> directory,
anyone can load it by giving a URL that specifies
the file:

<<<
declare
Fact={Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/fact"}

{Browse {Fact 10}}
>>>

<P> Anything stateless can be saved in a pickle,
including functions, procedures, classes,
records, and atoms.
Stateful entities, such as objects and variables,
cannot be pickled.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Remote computations</TITLE>

<P> An application can start a computation
on a given host that uses the resources
of that host and
that continues to interact with the
application.
The computation is specified as a functor,
which is the standard way to
define computations with the resources they need.

<P> First we create a new Mozart process
that is ready to accept new computations:
<<<
declare
R={New Remote.manager init(host:"sinuhe.sics.se")}
>>>

<P> Let's make the process do some work:
<<<
declare F X in
F=functor define X={Fact 30} end

{R apply(name:"" F)}  % Do the calculation remotely

{Browse X}            % See the answer
>>>

<P> If the remote computation needs resources,
you have to specify the base URL for the resources.

<SECTION><TITLE>Servers</TITLE>

<P> A server is a long-lived computation that provides a service to clients.
We will show progressively how to build different kinds of servers.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>The <<"Hello world">> server</TITLE>

<P> Let's build a basic server that returns the string <<"Hello world">>
to clients.
The first step is to create the server.
Let's do this and make the server available through a URL:
<<<
% Create server
declare Str Prt Srv in
{NewPort Str Prt}
thread
   {ForAll Str proc {$ S} S="Hello world" end}
end
proc {Srv X}
   {Send Prt X}
end

% Make server available through given URL:
{Pickle.save
   {Connection.offer Srv}
   "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/hw"}
>>>

<P> Now any client that knows the URL can access the server:
<<<
declare Srv in
Srv={Connection.take {Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/hw"}}

local X in
   {Srv X}
   {Browse X}
end
>>>
<P> This will show <<"Hello world">> in the browser window.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>The <<"Hello world">> server with stationary objects</TITLE>

<P> The previous section showed how to build a basic server
using a port to collect messages.
There is in fact a much cleaner way, namely by using
stationary objects.
Here's how to create the server:
<<<
declare
class HelloWorld
   meth hw(X) X="Hello world" end
end

Srv={NewStat HelloWorld hw(_)} % Requires an initial method
>>>
The client calls the server
by doing <<{Srv hw(X)}>>.
The class <<HelloWorld>> can be replaced by any class.
The only difference between this and creating
a centralized object is that <<New>> is replaced by <<NewStat>>.
This specifies the distributed behavior of the object.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>A compute server</TITLE>

<P> One of the promises of distributed computing is making
computations go faster by exploiting the parallelism
inherent in networks of computers.
A first step is to create a compute server, that is,
a server that accepts any computation and uses
its computational resources to do the computation.
