  <TITLE>Failure Model</TITLE>

<P>Distributed systems have the partial failure
property, that is, part of the system can fail
while the rest continues to work.
Partial failures are not at all rare.
Properly-designed applications must take
them into account.
This is both good and bad for application design.
The bad part is that it makes applications more complex.
The good part is that applications can take
advantage of the redundancy offered by
distributed systems to become more robust.

<P>The Mozart failure model defines what failures
are recognized by the system
and how they are reflected in the language.
The system recognizes
permanent site failures that are instantaneous (fail-stop)
and both temporary and permanent communication failures.
The system provides mechanisms
to program with language entities that are subject
to failures.

<P>The Mozart failure model is accessed
through the module <ref.extern to="ozdoc:system"
key="chapter.fault"/<<Fault>>/.
This chapter explains and justifies this
functionality, and gives examples
showing how to use it.
We present the failure model in two steps:
the basic model and the advanced model.
To start writing fault-tolerant applications
it is enough to understand the basic model.
To build fault-tolerant abstractions it
is often necessary to use the advanced model.

<P>In its current state,
the Mozart system provides only the
primitive operations needed to detect failure
and reflect it in the language.
The design and implementation of
fault-tolerant abstractions
within the language
by using these primitives
is the subject of ongoing research.
This chapter and the next one give the first results
of this research.
All comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

<SECTION><TITLE>Fault states</TITLE>

<P>All failure modes are defined with respect to
both a language entity and a particular site.
For example, one would like to send a message
to a port from a given site.
The site may or may not be able to send the message.
A language entity can be in three fault states
on a given site:
<LIST>
<ITEM> The entity works normally (local fault state <<ok>>).
<ITEM> The entity is temporarily not working
(local fault state <<tempFail>>).
This is because a remote site crucial to the entity
is currently unreachable due to a network problem.
This fault state can go away.
A limitation of the current release is that
temporary problems are indicated only after
a long delay time.
<ITEM> The entity is permanently not working
(local fault state <<permFail>>).
This is because a site crucial to the entity
has crashed.
This fault state is permanent.
</LIST>
<P>If the entity is currently
not working, then it is guaranteed that
the fault state will be either <<tempFail>> or <<permFail>>.
The system cannot always determine
whether a fault is temporary or permanent.
In particular, a <<tempFail>> may hide a site crash.
However, network failures can always
be considered temporary since the
system actively tries
to reestablish another connection.


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Temporary faults</TITLE>

<P>The fault state <<tempFail>> exists to allow the
application to react quickly to temporary network problems.
It is raised by the system as soon as a network problem
is recognized.
It is therefore fundamentally different from a time-out.
For example, TCP gives a time-out after some minutes.
This duration has been chosen to be very long,
approximating infinity from the viewpoint of the
network connection.
After the time-out,
one can be sure that the connection is no longer working.

<P>The purpose of <<tempFail>> is quite different from a time-out.
It is to <EM>inform</EM> the application
of network problems, not to mark the <EM>end</EM> of a connection.
For example, an application might be connected to a given server.
If there are problems with this server, the application
would like to be informed quickly so that it can try connecting
to another server.
A <<tempFail>> fault state will therefore be relatively frequent,
much more frequent than a time-out.
In most cases, a <<tempFail>> fault state will eventually go away.

<P>It is possible for a <<tempFail>> state to last forever.
For example, if a user disconnects the network connection of a laptop
machine, then only he or she knows whether the problem is permanent.
The application cannot in general know this.
The decision whether to continue waiting or to stop the wait
can cut through all levels of
abstraction to appear at the top level (i.e., the user).
The application might then pop up a window to ask the user whether
to continue waiting or not.
The important thing is that the network layer does not make this decision;
the application is completely free to decide or to let the user decide.


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Remote faults</TITLE>

<P>The local fault states <<ok>>, <<tempFail>>,
and <<permFail>> say
whether an entity operation can be performed locally.
An entity can also contain information
about the fault states on other sites.
For example, say the current site is waiting for a variable binding,
but the remote site that will do the binding has crashed.
The current site can find this out.
The following remote problems are identified:
<LIST>
<ITEM> At least one of the other sites
referencing the entity can no longer
perform operations on the entity
(fault state <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
The sites may or may not have crashed.
<ITEM> All of the other sites referencing
the entity can no longer perform operations
on the entity
(fault state <<remoteProblem(permAll)>>).
The sites may or may not have crashed.
<ITEM> At least one of the other sites
referencing the entity is currently unreachable
(fault state <<remoteProblem(tempSome)>>).
<ITEM> All of the other sites
referencing the entity are currently unreachable
(fault state <<remoteProblem(tempAll)>>).
</LIST>
All of these cases are identified
by the fault state <<remoteProblem(I)>>,
where the argument <<I>> identifies the problem.
A permanent remote problem never goes away.
A temporary remote problem can go away,
just like a <<tempFail>>.

<P>Even if there exists a remote problem,
it is not always possible to
return a <<remoteProblem>> fault state.
This happens if there are problems
with a proxy
that the owner site does not know about.
This also happens
if the owner site is inaccessible.
In that case it might not be possible to learn
anything about the remote sites.

<P>The complete fault state of an
entity consists of at most one
element from the set
{<<tempFail>>, <<permFail>>}
together with at most two elements from the set
{<<remoteProblem(permSome)>>,
<<remoteProblem(permAll)>>,
<<remoteProblem(tempSome)>>,
<<remoteProblem(tempAll)>>}.
Permanent remote problems mask temporary ones,
i.e., if <<remoteProblem(permSome)>> is detected
then <<remoteProblem(tempSome)>> cannot be detected.
If a (temporary or permanent)
problem exists on <EM>all</EM> remote sites
(e.g., <<remoteProblem(permAll)>>)
then the problem also exists on <EM>some</EM>
sites (e.g., <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).


<SECTION><TITLE>Basic model</TITLE>

<P>We present the failure model in two steps:
the basic model and the advanced model.
The simplest way to start writing fault-tolerant
applications is to use the basic model.
The basic model allows to enable or disable
synchronous <EM>exceptions</EM> on language entities.
That is, attempting to perform operations
on entities with faults will
either block or raise an exception without doing the operation.
The fault detection can be enabled separately on each of two levels:
a per-site level or a per-thread level
(see <ptr to="levels">).

<P>Exceptions can be enabled on logic variables,
ports, objects, cells, and locks.
All other entities, e.g., records, procedures, classes,
and functors, cannot have enabled exceptions.
Attempting to enable an exception on such an
entity is allowed but does nothing.
If a logic variable is bound to a nonvariable
entity that has no enabled exceptions,
then the variable's enabled exceptions will be
transferred to the entity.
Otherwise, they are discarded.
If two logic variables are bound together,
then the result has the enabled exceptions
of one of the original variables.
Which one is not specified.
The enabled exceptions of the other are discarded.

<P>The advanced model allows to install or
deinstall <EM>handlers</EM> and <EM>watchers</EM>
on entities.
These are procedures that are invoked
when there is fault.
Handlers are invoked synchronously (when attempting
to perform an operation) and watchers are
invoked asynchronously (in their own thread as
soon as the fault state is known).
The advanced model is explained in
<ptr to="advanced.model">.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Enabling exceptions on faults</TITLE>

<P>By default, new entities are
set up so that an exception will be raised
on fault states <<tempFail>> or <<permFail>>.
The following operations are provided to do other
kinds of fault detection:
<LIST>
<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.defaultEnable FStates}>>
<ITEM> sets the site's default for detected fault states
to <<FStates>>.
Each site has a default that is set independently
of that of other sites.
Enabling site or thread-level detection for an entity
overrides this default.
Attempting to perform an operation on an entity with
a fault state in the default <<FStates>> raises an exception.
The <<FStates>> can be changed as often as desired.
When the system starts up, the defaults are set up as if
the call <<{Fault.defaultEnable [tempFail permFail]}>> had been done.

<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.defaultDisable}>>
<ITEM> disables the default fault detection.
This function is included for symmetry.
It is exactly the same as doing <<{Fault.defaultEnable nil}>>.

<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.enable Entity Level FStates}>>
<ITEM> is a more targeted
way to do fault detection.
It enables fault detection on a given entity at a given level.
If a fault in <<FStates>> occurs while attempting
an operation at the given level,
then an exception is raised instead of doing the operation.
The <<Entity>> is a reference to
any language entity.
Exceptions are enabled only if the entity is an
object, cell, port, lock, or logic variable.
The <<Level>> is <<site>>, <<'thread'(this)>>
(for the current thread), or <<'thread'(T)>>
(for an arbitrary thread identifier <<T>>).<NOTE
FOOT>Since <<thread>> is already used as a keyword in the language,
it has to be quoted to make it an atom.</NOTE>
More information on levels is given in
<ptr to="levels">.

<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.disable Entity Level}>>
<ITEM> disables
fault detection on the given entity at the given level.
If a fault occurs, then the system does nothing at the
given level, but checks whether any exceptions
are enabled at the next higher level.
This is <EM>not</EM> the same as <<{Fault.enable Entity Level nil}>>,
which always causes the entity to block at the given level.
</LIST>
<P>The function <<Fault.enable>> returns
<<true>> if and only if the
enable was successful, i.e., the entity was not already
enabled for that level.
The function <<Fault.disable>> returns
<<true>> if and only if the
disable was successful, i.e., the entity was already
enabled for that level.
The functions <<Fault.defaultEnable>> and
<<Fault.defaultDisable>> always return <<true>>.
At its creation, an entity is not enabled at any level.
All four functions raise a type error exception if their arguments
do not have the correct type.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Exception formats</TITLE>

<P>The exceptions raised have the format
<<<system(dp(entity:E conditions:FS op:OP) ...)>>>
where the four arguments are defined as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <<E>> is the entity on which the operation was attempted.
A temporary limitation of the current release is that
if the entity is an object, then <<E>> is undefined.
<ITEM> <<FS>> is the list of actual fault states occurring
at the site on which the operation was attempted.
This list is a subset of the list for which fault detection
was enabled.
Each fault state in <<FS>> may have an extra
field <<info>> that gives additional information about
the fault.
The possible elements of <<FS>> are
currently the following:
<LIST>
<ITEM> <<tempFail(info:I)>> and <<permFail(info:I)>>,
where <<I>> is in {<<state>>, <<owner>>}.
The <<info>> field only exists for
objects, cells, and locks.
<ITEM> <<remoteProblem(tempSome)>>, <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>,
<<remoteProblem(tempAll)>>, and
<<remoteProblem(permAll)>>.
</LIST>

<ITEM> <<OP>> indicates which attempted operation caused the exception.
The possible values of <<OP>> are currently:
<LIST>
<ITEM> For logic variables: <<bind(T)>>, <<wait>>, and <<isDet>>,
where <<T>> is what the variable was attempted to be bound with.
<ITEM> For cells:
<<cellExchange(Old New)>>,
<<cellAssign(New)>>, and
<<cellAccess(Old)>>,
where <<Old>> is the cell content before the attempted operation
and <<New>> is the cell content after the attempted operation.
<ITEM> For locks: <<'lock'>>.<NOTE
FOOT>Since <<lock>> is already used as a keyword in the language,
it has to be quoted to make it an atom.</NOTE>
<ITEM> For ports: <<send(Msg)>>,
where <<Msg>> is the message attempted to be sent to the port.
<ITEM> For objects:
<<objectExchange(Attr Old New)>>,
<<objectAssign(Attr New)>>,
<<objectAccess(Attr Old)>>, and
<<objectFetch>>,
where <<Attr>> is the name of the object attribute,
<<Old>> is the attribute value before the attempted operation,
and <<New>> is the attribute value after the attempted operation.
A limitation of the current release is that the attempted
operation cannot be retried.
The <<objectFetch>> operation exists because object-records
are copied lazily: the first time the object is used, the
object-record is fetched over the network, which might fail.
</LIST>

</LIST>

<SUBSECTION id="levels"><TITLE>Levels of fault detection</TITLE>

<P>There are three levels of fault detection, namely
default site-based, site-based, and thread-based.
A more specific level, if it exists,
overrides a more general level.
The most general is <EM>default site-based</EM>,
which determines what exceptions are raised
if the entity is not enabled at the site or thread level.
Next is site-based, which detects a fault for a
specific entity when an operation is tried on one
particular site.
Finally, the most fine-grained is
thread-based, which detects the fault for a
specific entity when an operation
is attempted in a particular thread.

<P>The site-based and thread-based levels have to
be enabled specifically for a given entity.
The call <<{Fault.enable Entity Level FStates}>> is
used, where <<Level>> is either <<site>> or
<<'thread'(T)>>.
The thread <<T>> is either the atom <<this>> (for the current thread),
or a thread identifier.
Any thread's identifier
can be obtained by executing <<{Thread.this T}>>
in the thread.

<P>The thread level is the most specific; if it is enabled
it overrides the two others in its thread.
The site level, if it is enabled, overrides the default.
If neither a thread nor a site level are
enabled, then the default is used.
Even if the actual fault state does not give an exception,
the mere fact that a level is enabled always overrides the
next higher level.

<P>For example, assume that the cell <<C>>
is on a site with
default detection for <<[tempFail permFail]>>,
and a thread-specific detection for <<[permFail]>>
in thread <<T1>>.
What happens if many threads try to do
an exchange if C's actual fault state
is <<tempFail>>?
Then thread <<T1>> will block, since it is set up
to detect only <<permFail>>.
All other threads will raise the exception <<tempFail>>
(since it is enabled by default).
Thread <<T1>> will continue the operation when and
if the <<tempFail>> state goes away.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Levels and sitedness</TITLE>

<P>The <<Fault>> module has both sited and unsited operations.
Both setting the default and enabling at the site level
are <EM>sited</EM>.
This protects the site from remote attempts
to change its settings.
Enabling at the thread level is <EM>unsited</EM>.
This allows fault-tolerant abstractions to be network-transparent,
i.e., when passed to another site they continue to work.

<P>To be precise, the calls
<<{Fault.enable E site ...}>> and <<{Fault.install E site ...}>>,
will only work on the home site of the <<Fault>> module.
A procedure containing these calls may be passed around
the network at will, and executed anywhere.
However, any attempt to execute either call
on a site different from the <<Fault>> module's
home site will raise an exception.<NOTE
FOOT>Note that each site has its own <<Fault>> module.</NOTE>
The calls <<{Fault.enable E 'thread'(T) ...}>>
and <<{Fault.install E 'thread'(T) ...}>> will work anywhere.
A procedure containing these calls may be passed around
the network at will, and will work correctly anywhere.

<SECTION id="advanced.model"><TITLE>Advanced model</TITLE>

<P>The basic model lets you set up the system to
raise an exception when an operation is attempted
on a faulty entity.
The advanced model extends this to <EM>call a
user-defined procedure</EM>.
Furthermore, the advanced model can call
the procedure <EM>synchronously</EM>,
i.e., when an operation is attempted,
or <EM>asynchronously</EM>, i.e.,
as soon as the fault is known, even
if no operation is attempted.
In the synchronous case,
the procedure is called a <EM>fault handler</EM>,
or just <EM>handler</EM>.
In the asynchronous case,
the procedure is called <EM>watcher</EM>.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Lazy detection with handlers</TITLE>

<P>When an operation is attempted
on an entity with a problem,
then a handler call replaces the operation.
This call is done in the context of the thread
that attempted the operation.
If the entity works again later
(which is possible with <<tempFail>>
and <<remoteProblem>>) then the
handler can just try the operation again.

<P>In an exact analogy to the basic model,
a fault handler can be installed
on a given entity at a given level
for a given set of fault states.
The possible entities, levels, and fault states
are exactly the same.
Handlers are installed and deinstalled with the
following two built-in operations:
<LIST>
<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.install Entity Level FStates HandlerProc}>>
<ITEM>installs handler <<HandlerProc>> on <<Entity>> at <<Level>>
for fault states <<FStates>>.
If an operation is attempted and there is a fault
in <<FStates>>, then the operation is replaced by
a call to <<HandlerProc>>.
At most one handler can be installed on a given entity
at a given level.
<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.deInstall Entity Level}>>
<ITEM>deinstalls a previously installed handler from
<<Entity>> at <<Level>>.
</LIST>
<P>The function <<Fault.install>> returns <<true>> if and only if the
installation was successful, i.e., the entity did not already
have an installation or an enable for that level.
The function <<Fault.deInstall>> returns <<true>> if and only if the
deinstall was successful, i.e., the entity had a handler installed
for that level.
Both functions raise a type error exception if their arguments
do not have the correct type.

<P>A handler <<HandlerProc>> is a three-argument
procedure that is called as <<{HandlerProc E FS OP}>>.
The arguments <<E>>, <<FS>>, <<OP>>,
are exactly the same as in a distribution exception.

<P>A modification of the current release with respect
to handler semantics is that
handlers installed on <EM>variables</EM> always retry
the operation after they return.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Eager detection with watchers</TITLE>

<P>Fault handlers detect failure synchronously,
i.e., when an operation is attempted.
One often wants to be informed earlier.
The advanced model allows the application to be informed
asynchronously, that is,
as soon as the site finds out about the failure.
Two operations are provided:
<LIST>
<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.installWatcher Entity FStates WatcherProc}>>
<ITEM>installs watcher <<WatcherProc>> on <<Entity>>
for fault states <<FStates>>.
If a fault in <<FStates>> is detected on the current site,
then <<WatcherProc>> is invoked in its own new thread.
A watcher is automatically deinstalled when it is invoked.
Any number of watchers can be installed on an entity.
The function always returns <<true>>, since it is always
possible to install a watcher.
<ENTRY> <<fun {Fault.deInstallWatcher Entity WatcherProc}>>
<ITEM>removes one instance of
the given watcher from the entity on the current site.
If no instance of <<WatcherProc>> was installed as a watcher, then
the function returns <<false>>.  Otherwise, it returns <<true>>.
</LIST>
<P>A watcher <<WatcherProc>> is a two-argument
procedure that is called as <<{WatcherProc E FS}>>.
The arguments <<E>> and <<FS>>
are exactly the same arguments are
in a distribution exception or in a handler call.

<SECTION><TITLE>Fault states for language entities</TITLE>

<P>This section explains the possible fault states
of each language entity in terms of its distributed semantics.
The fault state is
a consequence of two things:
the entity's distributed implementation and
the system's failure mode.
For example, let's consider a variable.
There is one owner site and a set of proxy sites.
If a variable proxy is
on a crashed site and the owner site
is still working,
then to another variable proxy this
will be a <<remoteProblem>>.
If the owner site crashes, then
all proxies will see a <<permFail>>.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Eager stateless data</TITLE>

<P>Eager stateless data, namely records, procedures,
functions, classes, and functors, are
copied immediately in messages.
There are no remote references to eager
stateless data, which are always local to a site.
So their only possible fault state is <<ok>>.

<P>In future releases, procedures, functions, and functors
will not send their code immediately in the message,
but will send only their global name.
Upon arrival, if the code is not present,
then it will be immediately requested.
This will guarantee that code is sent at most
once to a given site.
This will introduce fault states <<tempFail>> and <<permFail>>
if the site containing the code
becomes unreachable or crashes.


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Sited entities</TITLE>

<P>Sited entities can be referenced remotely
but can only be used on their home site.
Attempting to use one outside of its home
site immediately raises an exception.
Detecting this does not need any network operations.
So their only possible fault state is <<ok>>.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Ports</TITLE>

<P>A port has one owner site
and a set of proxy sites.
The following failure modes are possible:
<LIST>
<ITEM> Normal operation (<<ok>>).
<ITEM> Owner site down (<<permFail>>
and <<remoteProblem(I)>> where <<I>> is both <<permSome>>
and <<permAll>>).
<ITEM> Owner site unreachable (<<tempFail>>).
</LIST>
<P>A port has a single operation, <<Send>>,
which can complete if the fault state is <<ok>>.
The <<Send>> operation is asynchronous,
that is, it completes immediately on the
sender site and at some later point in time
it will complete on the port's owner site.
The fact that it completes on the sender site
does not imply that it will complete on the owner site.
This is because the owner site may fail.

<P><ptr to="safesend"> shows how to build a <<SafeSend>> abstraction
that only completes on the sender site if it completes
on the owner site.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Logic variables</TITLE>

<P>A logic variable has one owner site
and a set of proxy sites.
The following failure modes are possible:
<LIST>
<ITEM> Normal operation (<<ok>>).
<ITEM> Owner site down (<<permFail>> and
<<remoteProblem(I)>> where <<I>> is both <<permSome>>
and <<permAll>>).
<ITEM> Owner site unreachable (<<tempFail>>).
<ITEM> Some or all proxy sites down
(<<remoteProblem(I)>> where <<I>> is both <<permSome>> and <<permAll>>).
<ITEM> Some or all proxy sites unreachable
(<<remoteProblem(I))>> where <<I>> is both <<tempSome>> and <<tempAll>>).
</LIST>
<P> A logic variable has two operations,
binding and waiting until bound.
Bind operations are explicit in the program text.
Most wait operations are implicit since
threads block until their data is available.
The bind operation will only complete if the
fault state is <<ok>> or <<remoteProblem>>.

<P>If the application binds a variable,
then its wait operation is only guaranteed to complete if the
fault state is <<ok>>.
When it completes, this means
that another proxy has bound the variable.
If the fault state is <<remoteProblem>>,
then the wait operation may not be able
to complete if the problem exists
at the proxy that was supposed to bind the variable.
This is <EM>not</EM> a <<tempFail>> or <<permFail>>,
since a third proxy can successfully bind the variable.
But from the application's viewpoint, it may still
be important to know about this problem.
Therefore, the fault state <<remoteProblem>>
is important for variables.

<P>A common case for variables is the client-server.
The client sends a request containing a variable to the server.
The server binds the variable to the answer.
The variable exists only on the client and server sites.
In this case, if the client detects a <<remoteProblem>>
then it knows that the variable binding will be
delayed or never done.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Cells and locks</TITLE>

<P>Cells and locks have almost the same failure behavior.
A cell or lock has one owner site and a set of proxy sites.
At any given time instant,
the cell's state pointer or the lock's token
is at one proxy or in the network.
The following failure modes are possible:
<LIST>
<ITEM> Normal operation (<<ok>>).
<ITEM> State pointer not present and owner site down
(<<permFail(info:owner)>> and <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
<ITEM> State pointer not present and owner site unreachable
(<<tempFail(info:owner)>>).
<ITEM> State pointer lost and owner site up
(<<permFail(info:state)>>, <<remoteProblem(permAll)>>,
and <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
This failure mode is only possible for cells.
If a lock token is lost then the owner recreates it.
<ITEM> State pointer unreachable and owner site up
(<<tempFail(info:state)>>).
<ITEM> State pointer present and owner site down
(<<remoteProblem(permAll)>> and <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
<ITEM> State pointer present and owner site unreachable
(<<remoteProblem(tempAll)>> and <<remoteProblem(tempSome)>>).
</LIST>
<P>A cell has one primitive operation,
a state update, which is called <<Exchange>>.
A lock has two implicit operations,
acquiring the lock token and releasing it.
Both are implemented by the same distributed protocol.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Objects</TITLE>

<P>An object consists of
an object-record that is a lazy chunk
and that references
the object's features, a cell, and a class.
The object-record is lazy: it is copied to the site
when the object is used for the first time.
This means that
the following failure modes are possible:
<LIST>
<ITEM> Normal operation (<<ok>>).
<ITEM> Object-record or state pointer not present
and owner site down
(<<permFail(info:owner)>> and <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
<ITEM> Object-record or state pointer not present
and owner site unreachable
(<<tempFail(info:owner)>>).
<ITEM> State pointer lost and owner site up
(<<permFail(info:state)>>, <<remoteProblem(permAll)>>,
and <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
<ITEM> State pointer unreachable and owner site up
(<<tempFail(info:state)>>).
<ITEM> Object-record and state pointer present and owner site down
(<<remoteProblem(permAll)>> and <<remoteProblem(permSome)>>).
<ITEM> Object-record and state pointer present and owner site unreachable
(<<remoteProblem(tempAll)>> and <<remoteProblem(tempSome)>>).
</LIST>
Compared to cells,
objects have two new failure modes:
the object-record can be temporarily or permanently absent.
In both cases the object
cannot be used, so we simply consider the new failure modes
to be instances of <<tempFail>> and <<permFail>>.
