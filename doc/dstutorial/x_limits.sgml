  <TITLE>Limitations and Modifications</TITLE>

<P>The current release has the following limitations
and modifications with respect to the specification.
A <EM>limitation</EM> is an operation that is specified
but not possible in the current release.
A <EM>modification</EM> is an operation that is specified
but behaves differently in the current release.

<P>The limitations and modifications
listed here will be removed in future releases.

<SECTION><TITLE>Limitations</TITLE>

<P>The limitations are:
<list>
<item>The code of functions, procedures, classes, and functors
(but not objects) is always inserted in messages,
even this code is already present at the destination.
In future releases, these entities will be copied
across the network only
if they are not present on the destination site.
In both current and future releases, at most a single copy
of these entities can exist per site.
<item>The fault state <<tempFail>> is indicated only after
a long delay.
<item>If an exception is raised or a handler or watcher
is invoked for an <EM>object</EM>,
then the <<Entity>> argument is undefined.
For handlers and watchers, this limitation can
be circumvented by letting the handler or watcher
reference the object.
<item>If an exception is raised or a handler is invoked
for an <EM>object</EM>,
then the attempted object operation cannot be retried.
<item>A handler cannot be installed at the <<global>> level,
i.e., the call <<{Fault.install _ global _ _}>> is undefined.
If an attempt is made to install a <<global>> handler,
then a <<notImplemented>> exception is given.
</list>

<SECTION><TITLE>Modifications</TITLE>

<P>There is currently only one modification:
<list>
<item>A handler installed on a <EM>variable</EM> will retry
the operation (i.e., bind or wait) after it returns.
That is, the handler is inserted before the operation
instead of replacing the operation.
</list>
