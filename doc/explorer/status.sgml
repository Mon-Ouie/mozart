<chapter id="chapter.status">
<Title/Status Information/


<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Status bar/
The status bar displays the most important information
on the Explorer and the search tree.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/BAB/
To the left of the status bar the letters <Em/BAB/ (for
branch and bound) are displayed, if the Explorer is currently running
in best solution search mode. Otherwise, no letters are displayed.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Time/
The time gives the runtime spent so far
for exploration, where time for garbage collection is excluded. The
percentage figure displayed in parenthesis shows the amount of time
spent on copying.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Nodes/
The number of occurrences of each kind of node follows
then to the right. The choice node drawn in the status bar is of
special importance: if the search tree has been explored completely, the choice node is drawn as a closed
node, otherwise as an open choice node (see
<Ptr to="chapter.tree"> on open and closed choice nodes).
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Depth/
The depth shows the depth of the search tree, that is
the number of nodes on the longest path in the search tree.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Mouse pointer/
When the Explorer is idle, the mouse pointer
is displayed as an arrow. If the Explorer is exploring the search tree
the mouse pointer has the shape of a watch. During drawing, the mouse
pointer shows a pencil.
</Para>
