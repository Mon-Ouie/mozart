  <Title/The Menu Bar/

  <P>
    All operations available with the Explorer can be chosen from menu
    entries. Some operations can invoked by keyboard accelerators. The
    most important operations can be invoked with the mouse.
  </P>
 
  <P>
    Keyboard accelerators are shown to the right of menu
    entries. Accelerators beginning with <Kbd>C-</Kbd> require the
    control-key to be pressed together with the key.  Operations available
    via mouse buttons are tagged by a small figure to the left of the
    explanation.

      <Entry><Menu key="C-g"/Halt/
      <Item>
	Halts exploration of the search tree, but does not halt drawing of
	newly explored parts.

      <Entry><Menu key="C-c"/Break/
      <Item>
	Breaks both exploration and drawing of the search
	tree. Drawing is stopped as follows: not yet drawn subtrees
	are drawn as hidden.

      <Entry><Menu key="C-r"/Reset/
      <Item>
	Resets the Explorer such that only the top node
	of the search tree is explored and drawn.

      <Entry><Menu/Export Postscript&ellipsis;/
      <Item>
	Opens a window to choose a file. After a file has been selected,
	the drawing of the search tree is dumped to this file in postscript
	format.

      <Entry><Menu key="C-x"/Close/
      <Item>
	The Explorer window is closed. When the Explorer is

        If the current subtree is hidden, it gets unhidden. If the

        they remain hidden.

      <Item>

        do not contain a solution are hidden.

  <section id="section.menu.options">
    <Title/The Options Menu/

    <P>
      This menu contains access to dialogs from which the Explorer can
      be configured.
    </P>

    <P>
    <List>
      <Entry><Menu/Search &ellipsis;/
      <Item>
	Creates a dialog to set options for the Explorer's search engine.
      <P><Picture.extern to="search.gif" type=gif></P>
      <P>
	In the <Em/Search/ entry the kind of recomputation used during
	next and all solution search (see also <Ptr
	to="section.menu.search">) can be entered. Entering
	<Kbd/none/ means that in each distribution step during search
	a space is stored. Entering <Kbd/full/ means that no spaces at
	all are stored during search. Entering a number <Math/n/ means that
	only in each <Math/n/-th distribution step a space gets
	stored. Roughly, with a recomputation distance of <Math/n/, the
	time needed during search is increased by a factor of <Math/n/ and
	memory occupied is decreased by a factor of <Math/n/. 
      <P>
	In the <Em/Information/ entry the kind of recomputation used
	for accessing the information attached to nodes. Entering <Kbd/none/
	means that each choice and solved node stores a computation
	space. Entering <Kbd/full/ means that only the top node stores its
	corresponding computation space. The space of any other node is
	recomputed by redoing all distribution steps. The number of required
	distribution steps thus depends on the depth of the node. Entering a
	number <Math/n/ means that only nodes at a depth
	<Math/1/, <Math/n+1/, <Math/2n+1/, &ellipsis; store a computation
	space. Thus, in the worst case the access to a node's
	space recomputes <Math/n-1/ distribution steps.
      <P>
	Selecting <Em/Full Recomputation in Failed Subtrees/ means that in
	subtrees that are explored completely and do not contain a solution,
	no spaces are stored.
      <P>
	Pressing the buttons <Em/Normal/, <Em/Large/, and <Em/Huge/ enter
	values to the recomputation entries. <Em/Normal/ is the default setting
	for scripts which do not contain very much propagators (i.e., about a
	few hundred). The other two buttons suggest values for scripts
	with more propagators or deep search trees.

      <Entry><Menu/Drawing &ellipsis;/
      <Item>
	Creates a dialog to set options used for the drawing of the search
	tree.
      <P><Picture.extern to="draw.gif" type=gif></P>
      <P>The entries in the dialog are self-explanatory.

      <Entry><Menu/Postscript &ellipsis;/
      <Item>
	Creates a dialog to set options used for dumping the search
	tree in postscript format (see also <Ptr
	to="section.menu.explorer">).
      <P><Picture.extern to="post.gif" type=gif></P>
      <P>
        The format of the
	string to be entered in the <Em/Maximal size/ field 
	must be as follows:
      <P>
        <Em/num dim x num dim/
      </P>
      <P>
	where <Em/dim/ must be one of <Kbd/i/ (inch), <Kbd/c/
	(centimeter), <Kbd/m/ (millimeter), or <Em/p/ (point, that is
	<Math>1/72</Math> inch).
      </P>

    </List>
    </P>

    <P>
      The options can also be configured by sending a message to
      <<Explorer.object>>, for details see <Ptr to="chapter.object">.
