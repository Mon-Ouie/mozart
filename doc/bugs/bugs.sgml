    <Abstract>
    This documents summarizes known bugs in Mozart. New bugs can be
    reported by sending email to <REF.EXTERN
    TO="mailto:bugs@mozart-oz.org">bugs@mozart-oz.org</REF.EXTERN> or
    via our bug tracking system reachable under <REF.EXTERN
    TO="http://www.mozart-oz.org/cgi-bin/oz-bugs">http://www.mozart-oz.org/cgi-bin/oz-bugs</REF.EXTERN>.
    This URL is also a good starting point to find out more about
    already known bugs (fixed and unfixed ones). However it is
    intended to be used primarily by the developpers and also
    documents the state of the system currently being under
    development, so it might list bugs that do not appear in the
    released system and vice versa.

<p>

<list>
<item>
On some machines graphical applications get stuck immediately after
startup.
<p>
This problem is related to a bad interaction between Tcl/Tk and some
other background programs. We found that we get the problem if one of
the following programs is running (most liely there are more):
<list>
<item> babylon
<item> fortify agent
<item> sendback
</list>

The problem only appears on Windows NT and not on Windows 95. We
tracked it down that it looks to be a bug in NT itself. We don't know
any workaround yet except to kill the other program, sorry. So we
propose the following: try to kill background programs one after the
other before starting Mozart until Mozart works.

<item> Mozart tries to create temporary files directly under
<kbd>C:\</kbd>. This might lead to two different problems: a user
might not have permission to create files under <kbd>C:\</kbd> and
secondly Windows might get stuck if too many temporary files are
created under <kbd>C:\</kbd>.
<p>
Workaround: set the environment variable <kbd>TMPDIR</kbd> to point to
<kbd>C:\TEMP</kbd> before starting up Mozart for example
by adding <p>
<code>
set TMPDIR=C:\TEMP
</code>
<p>
to your <kbd/autoexec.bat/.

<title/Linux/
<p>
<list>
<item> On some early versions of the Linux 2.2 kernel Mozart might
crash with a SEGV. This is related to a bug in Linux implementation of
mmap.
<p>
Workaround: use version 2.0.37 or upgrade to a newer 2.2 kernel.
