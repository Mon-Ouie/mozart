      <dt><a href="../tutorial/" class=section name=tutorial>The Oz Tutorial</a></dt>
      <dd><p>provides an easy introduction to this rich and many faceted
language. It covers major issues of syntax, semantics, programming
paradigms, and design.  All programming concepts are illustrated with
code snipets which the reader is encouraged to try for himself.</p>

      <dt><a href="../fdt/" class=section name=fdt>The Finite Domain Constraint
Programming Tutorial</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of constraint
programming in Oz.  The approach rests on the two complementary
techniques of constraint propagation and constraint distribution.
Constraint propagation is an efficient inference mechanism obtained
with concurrent propagators accumulating information in a constraint
store. Constraint distribution splits a problem into complementary
cases once constraint propagation cannot advance further.  The
tutorial focuses on combinatorial problems that can be
stated with variables ranging over finite sets of nonnegative
integers.  Problems in this class range from puzzles to real world
applications as diverse as scheduling, ware house allocation,
configuration and placement.</p>

      <dt><a href="../constraints/" class=section name=constraints
>Problem Solving With Constraints in Oz</a></dt>
      <dd><p>illustrates how difficult problems can be modelled
elegantly and solved efficiently with finite sets constraints.  It
then demonstrates how new constraint systems can be implemented in C++
and added to the system.  Finally it shows how attacking a problem
with a combination of two constraint systems can produce an order of
magnitude improvement in problem solving speed and memory requirements
over attacking it with either one alone.</p>

      <dt><a href="../apptut/" class=section name=apptut
             >The Application Programming
Tutorial</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of designing and creating
stand-alone applications in Oz, and puts great emphasis on
<em>modular</em> development.  Many design patterns are discussed and
illustrated with small programs, &eg; concurrency, client/server
applications, and distributed applications.  The tutorial also reveals
how trivial it is to interface with C/C++.</p>

      <dt><a href="../wp/" class=section name=wp>The Window Programming
Tutorial</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of creating graphical user
interfaces
for Oz application. It documents and illustrates extensively Mozart's
high-level object-oriented interface to Tk.  Every trick is
illustrated with a code fragment and the corresponding graphical
picture.  The reader is highly encouraged to try each example as he
works his way through the tutorial.</p>

      <dt><a href="../op/" class=section name=op>The Open Programming
Tutorial</a></dt>
      <dd><p>introduces the reader to the art of creating applications that
communicate with their environment.  It documents and illustrates
Mozart's object-oriented interface to IO facilities, such as files,
sockets, and processes.</p>
