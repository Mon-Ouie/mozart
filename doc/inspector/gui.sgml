<CHAPTER id="chapter.gui"><TITLE/GUI Configuration/
  <P>
    The Inspector is widely user configurable. The options are basically
    organized in two groups as follows:
    <LIST>
      <ITEM>
        Structure-related options control what node representation the
        Inspector chooses for a given value.  These include the traversal
        limits, mode (tree or graph) and the mapping details.
      <ITEM>
        Appearance-related options control the display style to use, such as
        fonts, colors, and subtree alignment, &ie;, how subtrees are arranged.
    </LIST>
  <P>
    Since the Inspector handles more than one widget, the user can specify
    whether the settings should affect all widgets or the active widget only.
  <P>
    This chapter explains how to navigate through the graphical configuration
    dialog.
  <SECTION id="section.gui.structure"><TITLE/Structure Settings/
  <P>
    <PTR to="figure.dialog"> shows the structure-related options.
    <FIGURE id="figure.dialog">
      <CAPTION/The selection dialog: <Q/Structure/ tab/
      <PICTURE.EXTERN to="dialog1.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  <PARA><TITLE/Traversal/
    The <Q/Traversal/ box allows to change the default exploration limits for
    newly inspected values.  See <PTR to="section.interactive.exploration">
    for details on how these parameters are used.
  <PARA><TITLE/Representation/
    The <Q/Representation/ box allows to configure the traversal mode.
    In <EM/tree mode/, all structures are displayed as their (possibly
    infinite) tree unrolling, up to the traversal limits.  In particular,
    this mode does not detect cycles.  In contrast, <EM/relation mode/ both
    detects cycles and shared substructure.  Relation mode also requires to
    select the equivalence relation to use.  (Note that the corresponding
    combo box is active only when relation mode is selected.)
  <P>
    By default, the following equivalence relations are supported:  The default
    of <Q/token equality/ uses <<System.eq>>, while <Q/structural equality/ is
    unification-based.  See <PTR to="section.configure.relations"> for details
    on how to add new relations.
  <PARA><TITLE/Mapping/
    The <Q/Mapping/ box allows to change the assignment of auto-mappings
    for the selected type.  A type is selected via the corresponding combo
    box to the right (see <PTR to="figure.dialog">).
  <P>
    Auto-mappings can be deactivated or activated for specific types by
    first selecting the type, then either clicking <Q/No default mapping/
    or <Q/Apply/, respectively.  The latter then requires to select one
    of the registered mapping functions for that type.  (Note again that the
    corresponding combo box box is active only if <Q/Apply/ is selected.)
  <P>
    See <PTR to="section.configure.mappings"> for details on how to add
    new mappings.
  <SECTION><TITLE/Appearance Settings/
  <P>
    <PTR to="figure.appearance"> shows the appearance-related options.
    It should be self-explanatory.
    <FIGURE id="figure.appearance">
      <CAPTION/The selection dialog: <Q/Appearance/ tab/
      <PICTURE.EXTERN to="dialog2.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  <SECTION><TITLE/Configuration Range/
  <P>
    <PTR to="figure.range"> shows the options controlling the applicability
    of the settings made on the previous tabs.  Again, this should be
    self-explanatory.
  <P>
    <FIGURE id="figure.range">
