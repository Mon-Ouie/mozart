<CHAPTER id="chapter.gui"><TITLE>GUI Configuration</TITLE>
  <SECTION><TITLE>Overview</TITLE>
  <P>
    The Inspector is widely user configurable. The options are basically organized in two groups
    as follows.
  </P>
  <P>
    <LIST>
      <ITEM>
        Structure related options. These options control how the Inspector creates the
        node representation from a given value. They include the traversal limits,
        mode switching (tree or graph) and the mapping details.
      <ITEM>
        Visual related options. These options control the visual aspects of drawing such as
        fonts, colors and subtree alignment. The latter specifies how subtrees are arranged.
    </LIST>
  </P>
  <P>
    Since the Inspector handles more than one widget, the user can specify whether the
    settings affect all widgets or the active widget only.
  </P>
  <P>
    This chapter explains how to navigate through the graphical configuration dialog.
  </P>
  <SECTION><TITLE>Structure Settings</TITLE>
  <P>
    <FIGURE id="figure.dialog">
      <CAPTION>The selection dialog: Structure Tab</CAPTION>
        <PICTURE.EXTERN to="dialog1.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  </P>
  <P>
    Figure <PTR to="figure.dialog"> shows the structure related options.
  </P>
  <PARA><TITLE>Traversal</TITLE>
    The Traversal box allows to change the exploration limits and should be self-explanatory.
  </PARA>
  <PARA><TITLE>Representation</TITLE>
    This box allows to configure the traversal mode. The tree mode shows all structures as a
    tree with respect to the traversal limits and does not reflect cycles. Activating the relation
    mode also requires to select the relation being used to detect equality. The corresponding
    combo box is active only if relation mode has been selected.
  </PARA>
  <P>
    The GUI does not
    allow to add new equalities
    but only to select from existing ones via the combo box. It defaults
    to token equality and structural equality (unification based). See X for details on how
    to add a new equality.
  </P>
  <PARA><TITLE>Mapping</TITLE>
    This box allows to change the assignment of auto-mappings for the selected type. A type
    is selected via the corresponding combo box to the right (see figure <PTR to="figure.dialog">).
  </PARA>
  <P>
    If the type has been selected, you can deactivate or activate mapping
    by either clicking the radio button labeled <Code>"No default mapping"</CODE> or
    <CODE>"Apply"</CODE>, respectively. The latter then requires to select the function to be
    applied from the collection of known mapping functions of that type. This is done via the
    corresponding combo box. Again, this box is activated only if <CODE>"Apply"</CODE> has been
    selected.
  </P>
  <P>
    The GUI does not allow to add new mappings. See X for details on how to achieve this.
  </P>
  <SECTION><TITLE>Appearance Settings</TITLE>
  <P>
    <FIGURE id="figure.appearance">
      <CAPTION>The selection dialog: Appearance Tab</CAPTION>
        <PICTURE.EXTERN to="dialog2.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  </P>
  <P>
    Figure <PTR to="figure.appearance"> shows the appearance tab. It should be self-explanatory.
  </P>
  <SECTION><TITLE>Configuration Range</TITLE>
  <P>
    <FIGURE id="figure.range">
      <CAPTION>The selection dialog: Range Tab</CAPTION>
        <PICTURE.EXTERN to="dialog3.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  </P>
  <P>
    Figure <PTR to="figure.range"> shows the range tab. It should be self-explanatory.
