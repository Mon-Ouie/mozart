<CHAPTER id="chapter.basic"><TITLE/Inspector Basics/
  <P>
    This chapter provides some basic understanding about how the Inspector
    can be used.
  <SECTION><TITLE/Simple Invocation/
  <P>
    The simplest usage of the Inspector is to execute the statement
    <<{Inspect ?_{X}}>>, where ?_{X} can be any Oz value.  Unless the
    Inspector window is already open, this will create a new window
    (see <PTR to="figure.usage">) displaying the given value.
    It is possible to inspect more than one value at the same time.
    By default, new values are appended to the current window.
    <FIGURE id="figure.usage">
      <CAPTION/The Oz Inspector/
      <PICTURE.EXTERN to="use.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  <SECTION><TITLE/Inspecting within Multiple Widgets/
  <P>
    In addition, the Inspector can handle arbitrarily many viewing windows
    (<EM/widgets/) which can be accessed and configured independently.
  <SUBSECTION><TITLE/Handling Widgets/
  <P>
    To open a new display widget, click <Q/Add new Widget/ from the Inspector
    menu as shown in <PTR to="figure.panes">.
    <FIGURE id="figure.panes">
      <CAPTION/Adding a new display widget/
      <TABLE>
        <TR><TD><PICTURE.EXTERN to="panes1.gif" type=gif>
        <TR><TD><PICTURE.EXTERN to="panes2.gif" type=gif>
      </TABLE>
    </FIGURE>
  <P>
    With more than one widget open, the notion of the <EM/active widget/
    matters.  The active widget receives all work caused by applications
    of <<Inspect>>.  By default, the initial widget is the active widget.
    This can be changed using the <KEY/TAB/ key. The active widget is
    marked with an extra black box around its viewing area.
  <P>
    To show the value ?_{X} in the ?_{I}-th window, execute the statement
    <<{InspectN ?_{I} ?_{X}}>>.  The widgets are numbered starting at zero.
  <P>
    The active widget can be removed by clicking <Q/Delete active Widget/
    from the Inspector menu (see <PTR to="figure.panes">).  The widget below
    the active widget becomes the new active widget.  If only a single widget
    is left, this action is ignored.
  <SECTION><TITLE/Value Representation/
  <P>
    The Inspector can be configured to display values using either a
    tree-like or graph-like representation (see <PTR to="figure.views">).
    <FIGURE id="figure.views">
      <CAPTION/Three views on the same datastructure/
      <PICTURE.EXTERN to="views.gif" type=gif>
    </FIGURE>
  <PARA><TITLE/Tree/
    The value will be shown as a tree with respect to given depth and width
    exploration limits.  Values larger than the given limits are truncated,
    the cut positions being indicated by down and right arrows, respectively.
  <PARA><TITLE/Graph/
    The value will be shown not only with respect to given depth and width
    exploration limits but also with respect to an equivalence relation:
    Repeatedly occurring sub-values will only be displayed once, all later
    occurrences being replaced by references to the first occurrence.
    This yields a more compact representation revealing more information
    about the value's structure. Equivalence is computed in a depth-first
    left-to-right traversal over the entire (truncated) value.
