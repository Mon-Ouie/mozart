<ITEM> <<getFocus(force:B)>> : if <<B>> is <<false>> (which is the default) :  if the application currently has the input focus on window's display, this command resets the input focus for window's display to window. If the application doesn't currently have the input focus on window's display, window will be remembered as the focus for its top-level; the next time the focus arrives at the top-level, it will be redirected it to window. If <<B>> is <<true>> : sets the focus of window's display to window, even if the application doesn't currently have the input focus for the display. This command should be used sparingly, if at all. In normal usage, an application should not claim the focus for itself; instead, it should wait for the window manager to give it the focus. <<B>> must be a boolean.
