<ITEM> <<exportselection:B>> : Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget should also be the X selection. If the selection is exported, then selecting in the widget deselects the current X selection, selecting outside the widget deselects any widget selection, and the widget will respond to selection retrieval requests when it has a selection. The default is usually for widgets to export selections. <<B>> must be a boolean.
