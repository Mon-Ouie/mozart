  <Title/Introduction/
  <P>
    This document describes the base environment of the &Oz; programming
    language.  The environment is a mapping of identifiers to values.  The
    values are organized in modules (modeled as records) and are available
    via field selection from their respective module; some values are
    available directly (without the need for selection) for convenience.
  <P>
    Your actual environment may be a superset of the one described by this
    document, depending on the &Oz; implementation you are running.  For
    instance, the Mozart system defines more procedures when working in the
    interactive development system as described in <Ptr to="mozart-opi"
    info="Section 4.5">.
