    <Title/How It Works/

    <P>
      Application execution is controlled by MIME types. A Mozart
      application has the MIME type
      <Kbd>application/x-oz-application</Kbd> and the
      filename extension <Kbd/oza/.
    </p>

    <Title/Information Needed/

    <P>
      To make your Web Browser Mozart Application enabled, it needs to
      know the following bits of information:
      <List>
        <Entry>Mime type
        <Item> This is <Kbd>application/x-oz-application</Kbd>.
        <Entry>File extension
        <Item> This is <Kbd>oza</Kbd>.
        <Entry>Program location
        <Item> Where the Oz engine to execute Applications resides. For
        example, if Mozart has been installed in
        <Kbd>/usr/local/oz</Kbd>, this is
        <Kbd>/usr/local/oz/bin/ozengine</Kbd>.
      </List>
    </P>

    <P>
      Additionally, you have to have Mozart installed, which is
      documented ???.
