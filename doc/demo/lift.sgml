    This demo performs a simple simulation of lifts. It can be operated
    both in an interactive (<Ptr to="section.lift.interactive">) mode
    or fully automatically (<Ptr to="section.lift.automatic">).

          Request
        <Item>
	  Clicking one of the triangles on the left
	  issues a request for a lift to the respective floor
	  for service in the indicated direction. The lift that
	  can serve the request quickest (according to its current
	  schedule)
	  will be sent to the requesting floor.

          Send
        <Item>
	  On arrival of a lift, a console will pop up requesting the user
	  to indicate the goal.
	  While the console is visible, the corresponding lift is not
	  available for other requests. 
	  Once the user clicks one of the circles, 
	  the lift will add the corresponding request into its schedule and 
	  serve it.

          Start
        <Item>
	  Clicking the button marked <Em/start/ generates
	  a random sequence of lift requests and serves them just as the
	  requests generated interactively.
	
        <Entry>
	  Stop
        <Item>
	  Clicking the button again, now marked <Em/stop/,
	  stops the automatic generation of lift requests.

    <P>
      Interactive lift requests can be
      issued in addition.
