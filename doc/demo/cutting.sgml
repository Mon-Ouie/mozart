    <P>
      Given a number of small glass plates that must be cut from a
      large target glass plate. Additionally, cuts can only be
      straight and must cut the entire remaining plate.
      Cuts must alternate between x and y direction. The first
      cut must be in y direction.
    </P>

    <P>
      The number entries allow to enter the number of glass plates
      that are to be cut from the target plate. Both x- and y-size of
      the target plate can be edited by the lower number entries as
      well.
    </P>

    <P>
      The status window gives suggestions on whether all glass plates
      can be cut from the target plate.
