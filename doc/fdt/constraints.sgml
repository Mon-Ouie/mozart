This section presents the architecture of
constraint-based problem solving at the concrete
instance of finite domain problems.  We will often
refer to the underlying solution method with the
slogan <q/propagate and distribute/.  The slogan
recalls the two inference rules of the method,
constraint propagation and constraint
distribution.

<section id="subsecFDP"><title/Finite Domains and Constraints/<p>

A <def/finite domain/ is a finite set of
nonnegative integers.  The notation m#n stands
for the finite domain m,&ellipsis;,n.
<p>
A <def/constraint/ is a formula of predicate logic.
Here are typical examples of constraints occurring
with finite domain problems:
<p><math>
~$
\begin{eqnarray*}
&ampersand;X=67
\qquad
X\in0\#9
\qquad
X=Y\\
&ampersand;X^2-Y^2=Z^2
\qquad
X+Y+Z<U
\qquad
X+Y\neq5\cdot Z\\
&ampersand;X_1,\ldots,X_9\;\hbox{are pairwise distinct}
\end{eqnarray*}$~
</math><p>

<para><title/domain constraints/
A <def/domain constraint/
takes the form <math/x\in D/, where ?{D}
is a finite domain.  Domain constraints can
express constraints of the form <math/x=n/ since <math/x=n/
is equivalent to <math/x\in n\#n/.

<para><title/basic constraints/
A <def/basic constraint/ takes one of the following forms:
<math/x=n/, <math/x=y/, or <math/x\in D/, where ?{D} is a finite
domain.

<para><title/finite domain problems/
A <def/finite domain problem/ is a finite set ?{P} of
quantifier-free constraints such that&fsp;?{P} contains a
domain constraint for every variable occurring in
a constraint of ?{P}.  A <def/variable assignment/
is a function mapping variables to integers.

<para><title/solutions/
A <def/solution/  of a finite
domain problem ?{P} is a variable assignment that
satisfies every constraint in&nbsp;?{P}.
<p>
Notice that a finite domain problem has at most
finitely many solutions, provided we consider
only variables that occur in the problem (since
the problem contains a finite domain constraint
for every variable occurring in it).
</section>
<section id="subsecFDCP"><title/Constraint Propagation/<p>

Constraint propagation is an inference rule for
finite domain problems that narrows the domains
of variables.  For instance, given the inequation
<p><math/X<Y/<p>
and the domain constraints
<p><math/X\in23\#100
\qquad
\hbox{and}
\qquad
Y\in1\#33,
/<p>
constraint propagation can narrow the domains of
?{X} and ?{Y} to
<p><math/
X\in23\#32
\qquad
\hbox{and}
\qquad
 Y\in24\#33.

<section><title/Spaces, Propagators, and Constraint Stores/
<p>
The computational architecture for constraint
propagation is called a <def/space/ and consists
of a number of propagators connected to a
constraint store:
<picture latex>
\begin{pspicture}(6,3)\footnotesize
\rput(1,2.6){\rnode{ta}{\bf \large Propagator}}
\rput(5,2.6){\rnode{tz}{\bf \large Propagator}}
\rput(3,2.6){\rnode{bla}{\bf .$\;$.$\;$.}}
\rput(3,1){\ovalnode{store}{\bf \large Constraint Store}}
\ncline[nodesep=3pt]{<-}{store}{ta}\ncline[nodesep=3pt]{<-}{store}{tz}
\end{pspicture}
</picture>
The <def/contraint store/ stores a conjunction of
basic constraints up to logical equivalence.  An
example for such a conjunction is
<p><math/
X\in0\#5
\;\land\;
Y=8
\;\land\;
Z\in13\#23.
/<p><p>
The <def/popagators/ impose nonbasic constraints,
for instance, <math/X<Y/ or <math/{X^2+Y^2=Z^2}/.  A
propagator for a constraint&nbsp;?{C} is a concurrent
computational agent that tries to narrow the
domains of the variables occurring in&nbsp;?{C}.
<p>

<para><title/example of communicating propagators/
Two propagators that share a variable ?{X} can
communicate with each other through the
constraint store.  To see an example for
communicating propagators, suppose we have two
propagators imposing the constraints
<p><math/
X+Y=9
\qquad
2\cdot X+4\cdot Y=24
/<p>
over a constraint store containing the following
information about ?{X} and ?{Y}:
<p><math/
X\in0\#9
\qquad
Y\in0\#9.
/<p><p>
As is, the first propagator cannot do anything.  The
second propagator, however, can narrow the domains of
both ?{X} and ?{Y}:
<p><math/
X\in0\#8
\qquad
Y\in2\#6.
/<p><p>
Now the first propagator can narrow the domain of
?{X}:
<p><math/
X\in3\#7
\qquad
Y\in2\#6.
/<p><p>
Now the second propagator can narrow the domains of
both ?{X} and ?{Y}:
<p><math/
X\in4\#6
\qquad
Y\in3\#4.
/<p><p>
This once more activates the first propagator,
which narrows the domain of&nbsp;?{X}:
<p><math/
X\in5\#6
\qquad
Y\in3\#4.
/<p><p>
Now the second propagator gets active once more and
determines the values of ?{X} and ?{Y}:
<p><math/
X=6
\qquad
Y=3.
/<p>
<para><title/telling a constraint/
Given a constraint store storing a constraint ?{S}
and a propagator imposing a constraint ?{P}, the
propagator can tell to the constraint store a
basic constraint ?{B} if the conjunction <math/S\land
P/ entails ?{B} and ?{B} adds new and consistent
information to the store.  To <def/tell/ a constraint ?{B}
to a constraint store storing the constraint ?{S}
means to update the store so that it holds the
conjunction <math/S\land B/.

<para><title/operational and declarative semantics of
propagators/
The <def/operational semantics/
of a propagator determines whether
the propagator can tell the store a basic
constraint or not.  The operational semantics of
a propagator must of course respect the <def/declarative semantics/ of the propagator, which
is given by the constraint the propagator
imposes.

We require that the constraint store be always
consistent; that is, there must always be at least
one variable assignment that satisfies all
constraints in the constraint store.

We say that the constraint store <def/determines/
\marginpar{determined variables} a variable ?{x} if
the constraint store knows the value of ?{x}, that
is, if there exists an integer ?{n} such that&fsp;the
constraint store entails <math/x=n/.

We say that a propagator is <def/inconsistent/ if
\marginpar{failed propagators} there is no variable
assignment that satisfies both the constraint
store and the constraint imposed by the
propagator (e.g., <math/X+Y=6/ over <math/X\in3\#9/ and
<math/Y\in4\#9/).  We say that a propagator is <def/failed/ if its operational semantics realizes
that it is inconsistent.

We say that a propagator is <def/entailed/
\marginpar{entailed propagators} if every variable
assignment that satisfies the constraint store
also satisfies the constraint imposed by the
propagator (e.g., <math/X<Y/ over <math/X\in3\#5/ and
<math/Y\in6\#9/).  As soon as the operational
semantics of a propagator realizes that the
propagator is entailed, the propagator ceases to
exist.

We require that the operational semantics of a
propagator detects inconsistency and entailment at
the latest when the store determines all variables
of the propagator.

We say that a propagator is {\em stable}
\marginpar{stable propagators} if it is either
failed or its operational semantics cannot tell
new information to the constraint store.

We say that a space is <def/failed/
\marginpar{failed, stable and solved spaces} if
one of its propagators is failed.  We say that a
space is <def/stable/ if all of its propagators
are stable.  We say that a space is <def/solved/
if it is not failed and there are no propagators
left.

When a space is created, its propagators start to
\marginpar{order of propagation does not matter}
tell basic constraints to the constraint store.
This propagation activity continues until the
space becomes stable.  An important property of
constraint propagation as we consider it here is
the fact that the order in which the propagators
tell information to the store does not matter.
When we start a space repeatedly from the same
state, it will either always fail or always
arrive at the same constraint store (up to
logical equivalence).

A variable assignment is called a <def/solution/
\marginpar{solutions of a space} of a space if it
satisfies the constraints in the constraint store
and all constraints imposed by the propagators.
The solutions of a space stay invariant under
constraint propagation and deletion of entailed
propagators.

<section id="SecFDIntDomProp"><title/Interval and Domain Propagation/<p>

There are two established schemes for the
operational semantics of a propagator.  <def/Domain
propagation/ narrows the domains of the variables
as much as possible; <def/interval propagation/
only narrows the bounds of a domain.

Consider a propagator for the constraint
<p><math>
{2\cdot X}=Y
</math><p>
over a constraint store
<p><math>
X\in1\#10
\qquad
Y\in1\#7.
</math><p>
Under domain propagation, the propagator can narrow
the domains to
<p><math>
X\in1\#3
\qquad
Y\in\{2,4,6\}.
</math><p>
Under interval propagation, the propagator can
narrow only the domain bounds, which yields
<p><math>
X\in1\#3
\qquad
Y\in2\#6.
</math><p>

It practice, interval propagation is usually
preferable over domain propagation because of its
lower computational costs.  We will see later that
Oz offers for some constraints two propagators, one
for interval and one for domain propagation.

<section><title/Incompleteness of Propagation/<p>

Constraint propagation is not a complete solution
method.  It may happen that a space has a unique
solution and that constraint propagation does not
find it.  It may also happen that a space has no
solution and that constraint propagation does not
lead to a failed propagator.

A straightforward example for the second case
consists of three propagators for
<p><math>
X\neq Y
\qquad
X\neq Z
\qquad
Y\neq Z
</math><p>
and a constraint store
<p><math>
X\in 0\#1
\qquad
Y\in 0\#1
\qquad
Z\in 0\#1.
</math><p>
This space has no solution. Nevertheless, none of the
propagators is inconsistent or can tell something to
the constraint store.

To see an example for the case where a unique
solution is not found by constraint propagation,
suppose we have interval propagators for the
constraints
<p><math/
 {3\cdot X}+{3\cdot Y}=5\cdot Z
\qquad
 X-Y=Z
\qquad
 X+Y=Z+2
/<p>
and a constraint store
<p>
<math>
X\in 4\#10
\qquad
Y\in 1\#7
\qquad
Z\in 3\#9.
</math>
This space has the unique solution <math/X=4/, <math/Y=1/,
<math/Z=3/.  Nevertheless, none of the propagators can
narrow a variable domain.

If we narrow the domains to
<p><math>
X\in 5\#10
\qquad
Y\in 1\#6
\qquad
Z\in 4\#9,
</math>
the space becomes unsatisfiable.  Still, none of the
above propagators is inconsistent or can narrow a
variable domain.


<section id="sec.dast"><title/Distribution and Search Trees/<p>

To solve a finite domain problem ?{P}, we can always
choose a constraint ?{C} and solve both <math/P\cup\{C\}/
and <math/P\cup\{\neg C\}/.  We say that we have {\em
distributed ?{P} with} ?{C}.

We can apply the idea to spaces.  Suppose ?{S} is a
stable space that is neither failed nor solved.  Then
we can choose a constraint ?{C} and <def/distribute
?{S} with ?{C}/.  Distribution yields two spaces, one
obtained by adding a propagator for ?{C}, and one
obtained by adding a propagator for <math/\neg C/.

The combination of constraint propagation and
distribution yields a complete solution method
for finite domain problems.  Given a problem, we
set up a space whose store contains the basic
constraints and whose propagators impose the
nonbasic constraints of the problem.  Then we run
the propagators until the space becomes stable.
If the space is failed or solved, we are done.
Otherwise, we choose a not yet determined
variable ?{x} and an integer ?{n} such that&fsp;<math/x=n/ is
consistent with the constraint store and
distribute the space with the constraint <math/x=n/.
Since we can tell both <math/x=n/ and <math/x\neq n/ to the
constraint store (the store already knows a
domain for ?{x}), chances are that constraint
propagation can restart in both spaces.
<p>
By proceeding this way we obtain a <def/search tree/ as
shown in <Ptr to="figFD1">.  Each node
of the tree corresponds to a space.  Each leaf of
the tree corresponds to a space that is either
solved or failed.  The search tree is always finite
since there are only finitely many variables all a
priori constrained to finite domains.

<section><title/An Example/<p>

To see the outlined propagate and distribute
method at a concrete example, consider the
problem specified by the following constraints:
<p><math>
~$\begin{eqnarray*}
X\neq7
\qquad
Z\neq2
\qquad
X-Z = {3\cdot Y}.
\\
X\in1\#8
\qquad
Y\in1\#10
\qquad
Z\in1\#10
\end{eqnarray*}$~
</math><p>
To solve the problem, we start with a space whose
store constrains the variables ?{X}, ?{Y}, and ?{Z} to
the given domains.  We also create three
propagators imposing the constraints <math/X\neq7/,
<math/Z\neq2/, and <math/X-Z={3\cdot Y}/.  We assume that the
propagator for <math/X-Z={3\cdot Y}/ realizes interval
propagation, and that the propagators for the
disequations <math/X\neq7/ and <math/Z\neq2/ realize domain
propagation.
<p>
The propagators for the disequations immediatedly
write all their information into the store and
disappear.  The store then knows the domains
<p><math/
X\in[1\#6\;\;8]
\qquad
Y\in1\#10
\qquad
Z\in[1\;\;3\#10]
/<p>
<p><math/[1\;\;3\#10]/<p> denotes the finite domain
<math/\{1\}\cup\{3,\ldots,10\}/).  The interval propagator for
<math/
X-Z = {3\cdot Y}
/
can now further narrow the domains to
<p><math/
X\in[4\#6\;\;8]
\qquad
Y\in1\#2
\qquad
Z\in[1\;\;3\#5].
/<p><p>
Now the space is stable but neither failed nor
solved.  Thus, we continue with a first
distribution step.  We choose to distribute with
the constraint <math/X=4/.  <Ptr to="figFD2"> shows
the resulting search tree.

<p>
The space obtained by adding a propagator for <math/X=4/
can be solved by propagation and yields the
solution
<p><math/
X=4
\qquad
Y=1
\qquad
Z=1.
/<p>
<p>
The space obtained by adding a propagator for
<math/X\neq4/ becomes stable immediately after this
propagator has written its information into the
constraint store, which then looks as follows:
<p><math/
X\in[5\#6\;\;8]
\qquad
Y\in1\#2
\qquad
Z\in[1\;\;3\#5].
/<p><p>
This time we distribute with respect to the
constraint <math/X=5/.
<p>
The space obtained by adding a propagator for <math/X=5/
fails since <math/X-Z={3\cdot Y}/ is inconsistent with the store
obtained by adding <math/X=5/.
<p>
The space obtained by adding a propagator for
<math/X\neq5/ becomes stable immediately after this
propagator has written its information into the
constraint store, which then looks as follows:
<p><math/
X\in[6\;\;8]
\qquad
Y\in1\#2
\qquad
Z\in[1\;\;3\#5].
/<p><p>
Now we distribute with respect to the constraint <math/X=6/.
<p>
The space obtained by adding a propagator for <math/X=6/
can be solved by propagation and yields the solution
<p><math/
X=6
\qquad
Y=1
\qquad
Z=3.
/<p>
<p>
Finally, the space obtained by adding a propagator
for <math/X\neq6/ can also be solved by propagation,
yielding the third and final solution
<p><math/
X=8
\qquad
Y=1
\qquad
Z=5.
/<p><p>

An alternative to the propagate and distribute
method is a naive enumerate and test method, which
would enumerate all triples <math/(X,Y,Z)/ admitted by
the initial domain constraints and test the
constraints <math/X\neq7/, <math/Z\neq2/, and <math/X-Z={3\cdot Y}/ for
each triple.  There are <math/8*10*10=800/ candidates.
This shows that constraint propagation can reduce
the size of the search tree considerably.

<section><title/Distribution Strategies/<p>

A <def/distributor/ is a computational agent
implementing a <def/distribution strategy/.  If a
thread creates a distributor, the thread is
blocked until the distributor has done its job.
If a distribution step is needed, the distributor
becomes active and generates the constraint with
which the space will be distributed.  If there is
more than one distributor in existence, one of
them is chosen indeterministically whenever a
distribution step is needed.
<p>
Usually, a distribution strategy is defined on a
sequence <math/x_1,\ldots,x_n/ of variables.  When a
distribution step is necessary, the strategy
selects a not yet determined variable in the
sequence and distributes on this variable.
<para><title/standard possibilities to distribute
on a variable/
There are a few standard possibilities to distribute on a variable ?{x}:
<list>
<item>
distribute with <math/x=l/, where ?{l} is the least
possible value for ?{x}.
<item>
distribute with <math/x=u/, where ?{u} is the largest
possible value for ?{x}.
<item>
distribute with <math/x=m/, where ?{m} is a possible
value for ?{x} that is in the middle of the least
and largest possible value for ?{x}.
<item class="Page" id="page.domainsplitting">
distribute with <math/x\le m/, where ?{m} is a possible
value for ?{x} that is in the middle of the least
and largest possible value for ?{x} (so called
<def/domain splitting/).
</list>
<para><title/naive distribution/
A <def/naive distribution strategy/ will select the leftmost
undetermined variable in the sequence.

<para><title/first-fail distribution/
A <def/first-fail distribution strategy/ will
select the leftmost undetermined variable in the
sequence whose domain in the constraint store has
minimal size.  In other words, it will select the
leftmost undetermined variable for which the
number of different possible values is minimal.
<p>
For most problems, first-fail strategies yield
much smaller search trees than naive strategies.
</section>

<section><title/Search Order/<p>

So far we have not specified in which order
search trees are explored.  Although this order
has no impact on the shape and size of a search
tree, it does have an impact on the time and
memory resources needed to find one or all
solutions:
<list>
<item>
If we are only interested in one solution, there is
no need to explore the entire search tree.
Ideally, we would just explore the path leading
from the root to the solution.
<item>
If we are interested in all solutions, we need to
explore the entire search tree.  However, whether
we explore the tree in depth-first or
breadth-first manner will make a big difference
in the memory needed.  The memory requirements of
breadth-first exploration are typically
exponentially larger than those of depth-first
exploration.
</list>
We will assume that the search engine explores
the search trees always in a depth-first fashion.
Moreover, when the engine distributes with a
constraint ?{C}, it explores the space obtained
with ?{C} first and the space obtained with <math/\neg
C/ second.
<p>
The above assumptions ensure that the exploration
of a search tree is a deterministic process,
provided the distribution strategy generating the
constraints to distribute with is deterministic.
</section>

<section><title/Models/<p>

A <def/model/ of a problem is a representation of
the problem as a finite domain problem (as
defined in <Ptr to="subsecFDP">).  A model
specifies the variables and the constraints
representing the problem.
<p>
Nontrivial problems will admit different models
and different distribution strategies, coming
with different computational properties and
search trees of different size.  The art of
constraint programming consists in finding for a
problem a model and a distribution strategy that
yield a computationally feasible search tree.
