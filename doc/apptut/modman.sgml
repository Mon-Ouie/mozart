  <Title/Module Managers/

  <p>
    So far we only dicussed how functor definitions can be developed
    in a modular fashion. This chapter explains how modular
    applications are executed.

  <p>
    The chapter is kept informal, a more detailed explanation of
    module managers and how module managers link applications can be
    found in <ptr to="modules.98">.

  <section id="section.modman.overview">
    <title/Overview/

    <p>
      A module manager maintains a <def/module table/. The module
      table maps urls (or to be more precise, full module urls) to
      modules or futures to modules.

    <p>
      A module manager <def/links/ a module at url ?{U} as follows:
      <list enum>
        <item>
          If ?{U} is already in the module table, the module manager
          returns the entry in the module table.
        <item>
          If ?{U} is not yet in the module table, the module manager
          creates a new future ?{M} and stores ?{M} under key ?{U} in the
          module table. As soon as the value of future ?{M} gets
          requested, the module manager <def/installs/ a module from
          the url ?{U}.
      </list>

    <p>
      Linking is done lazily: only when the value of the
      module is requested (usually implicitly, when the application
      attempts to access an exported feature), the module gets installed.
      A module with full
      module url ?{U} is installed as follows, where the installation
      procedure returns a module ?{M}:
      <list enum>
        <item>
          The pickled functor stored at ?{U} is loaded.
        <item>
          The module manager computes the full module urls for its
          imports. This step is detailed in <ptr
          to="section.modman.import"> and <ptr
          to="section.modman.resolve">.
        <item>
          It recursively links all functors with the full module urls
          computed before. This yields the <def/argument modules/.
        <item>
          It applies the functor body to the argument modules, which
          returns the module ?{M}.
      </list>

  <section id="section.modman.lazy">
    <title/Lazy Linking/

    <p>
      In the above section we have discussed that modules are subject
      to lazy linking: Only when a module is requested, the functor to
      compute that module gets loaded.

    <p>
      Lazy linking has dramatic effect on the startup time of an
      application: applications can start small in a fraction of a
      second and load additional functionality on demand. And all this
      happens completely transparently.

    <p>
      System modules are also subject to dynamic linking. Even though
      module managers give the impression that the system modules
      are always there, they are also loaded on demand. An application
      that takes good advantage of that fact is for example the Oz
      Programming Interface which starts quickly even though it
      imports all system modules.

  <section id="section.modman.import">
    <title/Import Specifications/

    <p>
     The entire import part of a functor is called the
      <def/import specification/. Each import specification consists
      of several <def/import clauses/. Each import clause consists of
      a mandatory <def/module name/ and an optional <def/module url/
      that must be preceded by the <<at>> keyword.

    <p>
      For example, in the import specification
<<<
import
   DB
   MyForm at 'Form.ozf'
>>>
      the first import clause is <<DB>> which just consists of the
      module name <<DB>> and does not provide a module url. The second
      import clause is <<MyForm at 'Form.ozf'>> which consists of the
      module name <<MyForm>> and the module url <<'Form.ozf'>>.

    <p>
      The first step in linking a functor is that the module manager
      computes for each import clause the <def/full module url/. This
      is done according to the following rules:
      <list enum>
        <item>
          If the import clause features a module url ?{U}, the full
          module name is ?{U}.
        <item>
          If the import clause consists of a module name ?{M} only,
          where ?{M} is the name of a system module, the full url is
          <<x-oz://system/?{M}>>, that is the module name prefixed by
          <<x-oz://system/>>.
        <item>
          If the import clause consists of a module name ?{M} only and
          ?{M} is not the name of system module, the full url is
          <<?{M}.ozf>>, that is the module name suffixed by <<.ozf>>.
      </list>

    <p>
      All currently defined system modules are listed in <ptr
      to="table.modman.system">.

    <title/Url Resolution/

    <p>
      Given the full url names for each import clause, the module
      manager determines the urls from which functors are to be
      loaded by <def/url resolution/. Url resolution takes two urls
      (one is called the <def/base url/ and the other is called the
      <def/local url/) as
      input and computes a new <def/resolved url/. The process of
      url resolution you already know from organizing your html-pages:
      a url for a relative href-link is resolved with respect to the
      base url of the containing document.

    <p>
      In this respect, a module manager will behave similarly to a
      web-browser.  When it
      installs a module that was loaded from url ?{U}, the latter's
      full import urls are resolved with respect to ?{U}.

    <title/User-defined Module Managers/

    <p>
      When the engine starts it has the root module manager that
      executes the root functor and subsequently links imported
      functors. However, in many cases it is desirable that
      applications can create private module managers that just link
      particular functors.

    <p>
      As an example, suppose we want to use more than a single data
      base as implemented by the functor <file/DB.ozf/ as shown in
      <ptr to="section.development.db">

    <p>
      In the Oz Programming Interface, we can link <file/DB.ozf/
      twice with two new and different module managers as follows:
<<<
[DBA]={Module.link ['DB.ozf']}
[DBB]={Module.link ['DB.ozf']}
>>>
      Both <<DBA>> and <<DBB>> refer to two independent data bases.

    <p>
      You can observe lazy linking easily. Browsing <<DBA>> as
      follows
      <<<{Browse DBA}>>>
      shows <samp/DBA&le;Future&gt;/, which means that <<DBA>> still
      refers to a future.  Requesting the module by, for example, adding
      an entry to the data base is also reflected in the Browser:
      the display of
      <samp/DBA&le;Future&gt;/ is replaced by a representation of the
      module's value.

    <p>
      That both module managers work independently can be verified by
      browsing <<DBB>>.

    <p>
      <<Module.link>> takes a list of urls, creates a new module
      manager and maps each url ?{U} to the module created by
      linking the functor at ?{U}. Reference documentation can be found
      in <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.module">.

  <section id="section.modman.opi">
    <title/Functors in the Oz Programming Environment/

    <p>
      Functors are first class entities in the language that can of
      course also be created in the Oz Programming Interface. This
      eases development of functors considerably.

    <p>
      Suppose the following demo functor definition
<<<declare
functor F
export Pam
define
   fun {DoPam Xs P Ys}
      case Xs of nil then Ys
      [] X|Xr then {DoPam Xr P {P X}|Ys}
      end
   end

   fun {Pam Xs P}
      {DoPam Xs P nil}
   end
end>>>
      After feeding the definition, the defined functor can be applied
      as follows:
<<<[M]={Module.apply [F]}>>>
      The module <<M>> can be used in the OPI as usual, that is
<<<{Browse {M.pam [1 2 3] fun {$ I} I+1 end}}>>>
      displays the list <<[4 3 2]>>.

    <p>
      <<Module.apply>> takes a list of functors as argument, creates a
      new module manager, applies each functor element and returns the
      resulting list of modules. It is also possible to specify the
      base url used in linking the argument modules of the applied
      functor. For more information see <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system"
      key="chapter.module">.


    <p>
      Of course, also other situations allow to take advantage of
      first-class functors and that they can be applied by module
      managers. In particular they are useful for remote module
      managers that create new Oz processes on networked
      computers.  You can learn more on this issue in <ptr.extern
      to="ozdoc:dstutorial">.
