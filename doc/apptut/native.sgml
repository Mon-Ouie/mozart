<PART>
  <TITLE/Foreign Extensions/
  <CHAPTER>
    <TITLE/Introduction/

    <P>Oz can be very simply extended with new functionality and
datatypes implemented in C or C++.  This capability is often used to
interface Oz to existing libraries: for example, the <NAME
type="library"/regex/ and <NAME type="library"/gdbm/ modules are
implemented in this fashion.</P>

    <PARA TYPE=APROPOS><TITLE/Native Functors/
Every extension is presented to the system in the form of a
<DEF/native functor/, &ie; a functor which happens to be implemented
in C or C++ rather than in Oz.</P>
