    <Abstract>

      This manual describes Ozcar, a symbolic debugger which provides
      well known features like single stepping, breakpoints, and
      environment inspectation.  Moreover, it supports debugging of
      multiple threads; their concurrent behaviour can be observed and
      manipulated.

      Ozcar has been smoothly integrated into the Oz Programming
      Interface: It can be started and stopped from within Emacs,
      which, additionally, shows the current position in a debugged
      program by highlightening the corresponding source line, loading
      files where neccessary, and serves as a means to set
      breakpoints.

      Finally, the application ozd is provided to debug standalone
      programs.
