<Section id="section.api.interfaces">
  <Title/Compiler Interfaces/
  <P>
    As said above, compiler engines are narrators.  The term <Q/compiler
    interface/ simply denotes a standard listener attached to a compiler
    engine.  This section presents what is required to implement a compiler
    interface.
  <P>
    First the notifications sent by compiler engines are documented.  These
    include normal compiler output and information about compiler state
    changes.  Then a specific compiler interface is described that makes
    many compilation tasks easy to control.
  <SubSection>
    <Title/Sent Notifications/
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Query Queue/
      <List>
        <Entry><<newQuery(?_{I} ?_{T})>>
        <Item>
          A new query&nbsp;?_{T} with identification&nbsp;?_{I} has been
          enqueued.
        <Entry><<runQuery(?_{I} ?_{T})>>
        <Item>
          The query&nbsp;?_{T} with identification&nbsp?_{I} is now being
          executed.
        <Entry><<removeQuery(?_{I})>>
        <Item>
          The query with identification&nbsp;?_{I} has been removed from
          the query queue, either because it finished executing or because
          it was dequeued by a user program.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Compiler Activity/
      <List>
        <Entry><<busy()>>
        <Item>
          The compiler is currently busy (&ie;, executing a query).
        <Entry><<idle()>>
        <Item>
          The compiler is currently idle (&ie;, waiting for a query to
          be enqueued).
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/State Change/
      <List>
        <Entry><<switch(?_{SwitchName} ?_{B})>>
        <Item>
          The given switch has been set to&nbsp;?_{B}.
        <Entry><<switches(?_{R})>>
        <Item>
          The settings of all switches is transmitted as a record mapping
          each switch name to its setting.
        <Entry><<maxNumberOfErrors(?_{I})>>
        <Item>
          The maximum number of errors after which to abort compilation
          has been set to&nbsp;?_{I}.
        <Entry><<baseURL(?_{AU})>>
        <Item>
          The base URL relative to which the <<require>> clause of computed
          functors is resolved has been set to ?_{AU}.
        <Entry><<env(?_{Env})>>
        <Item>
          The environment has been set to ?_{Env}.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Output/
      <List>
        <Entry><<info(?_{V})>>
        <Item>
          An information message&nbsp;?_{V} is to be printed out.
        <Entry><<info(?_{V} ?_{Coord})>>
        <Item>
          An information message&nbsp;?_{V}, related to the source coordinates
          ?_{Coord}, is to be printed out.
        <Entry><<message(?_{R} ?_{Coord})>>
        <Item>
          An error or warning message&nbsp;?_{R}, related to the source
          coordinates ?_{Coord}, is to be printed out.  ?_{R}&nbsp;has
          the standard error message format, described in <Ptr.Extern
          to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.error">.
        <Entry><<insert(?_{V} ?_{Coord})>>
        <Item>
          During parsing, the file named&nbsp;?_{V} has been read.
          The corresponding <<\insert>> directive (if any) was at source
          coordinates ?_{Coord}.
        <Entry><<displaySource(?_{TitleV} ?_{ExtV} ?_{V})>>
        <Item>
          A source text&nbsp;?_{V} with title&nbsp;?_{TitleV} is to be
          displayed; its format is the one for which the file extension
          ?_{ExtV} is typically used (such as <File/oz/ or <File/ozm/).
        <Entry><<attention()>>
        <Item>
          The error output buffer should be raised with the cursor at
          the current output coordinates (an error message should follow).
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Synchronization/
      <List>
        <Entry><<pong(?_{X})>>
        <Item>
          This is sent in response to a <<ping(_)>> or <<ping(_ ?_{X})>> query
          (see <Ptr to="section.api.engines">).  In the first case, <<unit>>
          is returned in&nbsp;?_{X}.
      </List>
  <SubSection>
    <Title/The <<Compiler.interface>> Class/
    <P>
      The <<Compiler.interface>> class is a subclass of the error listener
      class described in <Ptr to="appendix.narrator">.  Its purpose is
      to provide a standard listener powerful enough to server many
      purposes, to spare the user of defining an own listener.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Methods/
      In addition to the standard error listener interface, it supports the
      following methods.
      <List>
        <Entry><<init(?+{EngineO} ?+{VerboseL} &lt;= false)>>
        <Item>
          initializes a new compiler interface, attaching it to the
          compiler engine ?_{EngineO}.  ?_{VerboseL} can be one of <<true>>,
          <<false>>, or <<auto>>:  If <<true>>, all messages, including the
          compiler's banner, will be output.  If <<false>>, no messages
          will be output.  If <<auto>>, the interface will remain silent
          unless an error of warning message arrives, in which case it
          will become verbose.
        <Entry><<sync()>>
        <Item>
          waits until the compiler engine becomes idle.
        <Entry><<getInsertedFiles(??{Vs})>>
        <Item>
          returns a list of the file names that compilation has caused
          the inclusion of so far, in order of appearance.
        <Entry><<getSource(??{V})>>
        <Item>
          returns the source that has last been displayed by the
          compiler (typically some intermediate representation), or
          the empty string if none.
        <Entry><<reset()>>
        <Item>
          clears the internal lists of inserted files and the displayed
          source.
        <Entry><<clear()>>
        <Item>
          is the same as <<reset>>.
      </List>
