  <Title/Sent Notifications/
  <P>
    This section summarizes all notifications currently sent by the
    Mozart Compiler to the registered interfaces.
  <P>
    Note that source coordinates (usually called <<Coord>>) are always
    either <<unit>>, meaning there's no information, or of the form
    <<pos(FileName Line Column)>>, where <<FileName>> is an atom
    (<<''>> meaning there's none available) and <<Line>> and <<Column>>
    are integers.  Line numbering begins at&nbsp;1 and column numbering
    at&nbsp;0; a column number of <<~1>> means that none is known.

    <Title/Query Queue Notifications/
    <P>
      <List>
        <Entry><<newQuery(?_{I} ?_{T})>>
        <Item>
          A new query ?_{T} with identification ?_{I} has been enqueued.
        <Entry><<runQuery(?_{I} ?_{T})>>
        <Item>
          The query ?_{T} with identification ?_{I} is now being executed.
        <Entry><<removeQuery(?_{I})>>
        <Item>
          The query with identification ?_{I} has been removed from the query
          queue, either because it finished executing or because it was
          dequeued by a user program.

        <Entry><<idle()>>
        <Item>
          The compiler is currently idle (&ie;, waiting for a query to
          be enqueued).

          The settings of all switches is transmitted as a record mapping
          each switch name to its setting.
        <Entry><<maxNumberOfErrors(?_{I})>>
        <Item>
          The maximum number of errors after which to abort compilation
          has been set to ?_{I}.

    <P>
      <List>
        <Entry><<info(?_{V})>>
        <Item>
          An information message&nbsp;?_{V} is to be output.
        <Entry><<info(?_{V} ?_{Coord})>>
        <Item>
          An information message&nbsp;?_{V}, related to the source coordinates
          ?_{Coord}, is to be output.
        <Entry><<message(?_{R} ?_{Coord})>>
        <Item>
          An error or warning message&nbsp;?_{R}, related to the source
          coordinates ?_{Coord}, is to be output.  ?_{R}&nbsp;has the
          standard error message format, described in
          <File>mozart/share/lib/sp/Error.oz</File>.
        <Entry><<insert(?_{V} ?_{Coord})>>
        <Item>
          During parsing, the file named&nbsp;?_{V} has been read.
          The corresponding <<\insert>> directive (if any) was at source
          coordinates ?_{Coord}.
        <Entry><<displaySource(?_{TitleV} ?_{ExtV} ?_{V})>>
        <Item>
          A source text&nbsp;?_{V} with title&nbsp;?_{TitleV} is to be
          displayed; its format is the one for which the file extension
          ?_{ExtV} is typically used (such as <File/oz/ or <File/ozm/).
        <Entry><<attention()>>
        <Item>
          The error output buffer should be raised with the cursor at
          the current output coordinates (an error message should follow).
