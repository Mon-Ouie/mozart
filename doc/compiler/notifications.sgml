  <Title/Sent Notifications/
  <P>
    This section summarizes all notifications currently sent by the
    Mozart Compiler to the registered interfaces.
  <P>
    Note that source coordinates (usually called <<Coord>>) are always
    either <<unit>>, meaning there's no information, or of the form
    <<pos(FileName Line Column)>>, where <<FileName>> is an atom
    (<<''>> meaning there's none available) and <<Line>> and <<Column>>
    are integers.  Line numbering begins at&nbsp;1 and column numbering
    at&nbsp;0; a column number of <<~1>> means that none is known.

          <Item>

          <Item>
            The query with identification number <<Id>> has been removed
            from the query queue, either because it finished executing
            or because it was dequeued by a user program.
