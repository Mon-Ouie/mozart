  <Title/Getting a Unix version of Emacs/
  <P>
    The Oz Programming Interface (OPI) is based on the Emacs
    editor.  You can either use GNU Emacs version 19.28 or better
    which is available from
    <Ref.Extern to="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"><File
    >http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</File></Ref.Extern>
  <P>
    Oz also runs with XEmacs version 19.14 or higher, which is
    available from
    <Ref.Extern to="http://www.xemacs.org"><File>http://www.xemacs.org</File
    ></Ref.Extern>
  <P>
    For the inexperienced user we recommend using XEmacs, since it
    is distributed in binary form which simplifies installation.
    When the Oz programming environment starts, it tries to invoke
    Emacs via the command <<emacs>>.  If your version of Emacs
    has to be invoked with a different command name, say <<emacs20>>,
    you can achieve this by setting the environment variable <Var type=env
    /OZEMACS/ as in
    <<<setenv OZEMACS emacs20>>>
    or
    <<<export OZEMACS=emacs20>>>
    depending on your shell.
