  <title/Installing Binary Distributions/
  <p>
Installing Mozart is a very simple task; neither super-user privileges nor
special knowledge about system administration are required. Mozart is
distributed in binary form and configures itself on startup. Therefore
installation of Mozart only consists in unpacking an archive file into
any directory. To install Mozart on Unix you only have to read <ptr to=sec.unix>
and optionally <ptr to=sec.emacsunix> if you have not yet installed Emacs.

<p>
To install Mozart on Windows 9x/NT read <ptr to=sec.windows>

  <section id=sec.windows>
    <title>MS Windows 9x/NT</title>
    <p>Installing Mozart needs to be done in two steps.

<list ENUM>
<item> You have to install GNU Emacs first.
<item> Afterwards you install Mozart. (If you upgrade to
a newer version of Mozart you only have to perform the second step).
</list>

<p>First get the binaries for your particular platform:
<p>
<code display>
% cd /usr/local
% gunzip -cd mozart-version-platform.tar.gz | tar -xvf

    <subsection id=sec.emacsunix><title/Getting a UNIX version of Emacs/
<p>
    Oz needs a version of Emacs that supports the X Window System
environment. You can either use GNU Emacs version 19.28 or higher
which is available from <p>

<Ref.Extern to="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</Ref.Extern>
<p>

Oz also runs with XEmacs version 19.14 or higher, which is available
from <p>

<Ref.Extern to="http://www.xemacs.org">http://www.xemacs.org</Ref.Extern>
<p>

For the unexperienced user we recommend using XEmacs, since it is
distributed in binary form and its ease of installation. When Oz comes
uo, it tries to invoke Emacs via the command <code/emacs/. If your
version of Emacs has to be invoked with a different command name, say
<code/emacs20/, you can achieve this by setting the environment
variable <code/OZEMACS/ as in
<code display>
setenv OZEMACS emacs20
</code>
