    <title>MS Windows 9x/NT</title>

    <p>Installing Mozart needs to be done in two steps.

<list ENUM>
<item> You have to install GNU Emacs first.
<p>Download <Ref.Extern to="ftp://mozart.ps.uni-sb.de/pub/mozart/extras/emacs-20.3.1.exe">emacs-20.3.1.exe</Ref.Extern>
execute it, and follow the instructions.
<p>
More information about  GNU Emacs for MS Windows can be found under
<Ref.Extern to="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html">
http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html</Ref.Extern>
<P>
<item> Afterwards you install Mozart. (If you upgrade to
a newer version of Mozart you only have to perform the second step).
<p>
Get the self-extracting executable from the<Ref.Extern to="http://mozart.ps.uni-sb.de/download/winarchive.shtml">download page</Ref.Extern>,
execute it, and follow the instructions.

<chapter id=chapter.unix>
    <title/Unix/
<p>
To install a binary Mozart release on a Unix system you only have to
read <ptr to=sec.installunix> and optionally <ptr to=sec.emacsunix> if
you have not yet installed Emacs but want to devlop Oz applications
yourself.

    <section id=sec.installunix><title/Installing a Binary Mozart Release/
<p>
A binary Mozart release can be installed into any directory. There are
no paths compiled into the binaries. The system configures itself on
startup. In the following we explain the installation of Mozart into
the directory
<code display>
/usr/local/mozart
</code>
Replace this string in the following if you want to install into a
different directory.
<p>
After installation you should make your web browser Mozart application enabled, which is described in <ptr to="applets">.
<p>

<list ENUM>
<item>Download the binary tarballs for your particular platform from
<Ref.Extern
to="http://mozart.ps.uni-sb.de/download/">http://mozart.ps.uni-sb.de/download</Ref.Extern>.
<item>Unpack the tarballs by executing
<code display>
% cd /usr/local
% gzip -cd mozart-?{version}-?{platform}.tar.gz         | tar -xvf
% gzip -cd mozart-?{version}-?{platform}-contrib.tar.gz | tar -xvf
% gzip -cd mozart-?{version}-?{platform}-doc.tar.gz     | tar -xvf
</code>
Replace ?{version} and ?{platform} appropriately.
Depending on which packages you selected during download you may skip
one or more of the last three commands.
<item>[Optional] Extend your PATH environment variable:
<code display>
% setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/mozart/bin
</code>
<item>[Optional] Some people do not want to change each users PATH
variable, but prefer drawing links from a common bin directory to the
Mozart bin directory. In this case however you have to edit
<code display>
/usr/local/mozart/bin/oz
</code>
slightly at the beginning: simply uncomment and adapt the line
<code display>
#OZHOME=/usr/local/mozart
</code>
appropriately. Then you can draw links like this:
<code display>
% cd /usr/local/bin
% ln -s /usr/local/mozart/bin/* .
</code>
</list>
    </section>

    <section id=sec.emacsunix><title/Getting a UNIX version of Emacs/
<p>
The Oz programming environment (OPI) ist based on the Emacs
editor. You can either use GNU Emacs version 19.28 or higher which is
available from <p>

<Ref.Extern to="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</Ref.Extern>
<p>

Oz also runs with XEmacs version 19.14 or higher, which is available
from <p>

<Ref.Extern to="http://www.xemacs.org">http://www.xemacs.org</Ref.Extern>
<p>

For the unexperienced user we recommend using XEmacs, since it is
distributed in binary form which simplifies installation. When Oz comes
up, it tries to invoke Emacs via the command <code/emacs/. If your
version of Emacs has to be invoked with a different command name, say
<code/emacs20/, you can achieve this by setting the environment
variable <code/OZEMACS/ as in
<code display>
setenv OZEMACS emacs20
</code>
