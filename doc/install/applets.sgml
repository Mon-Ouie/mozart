<Chapter id="APPLETS">
  <Title/Enabling Oz Applets/

  <p>
    Most Mozart demos are available as <em/Oz applets/: Oz
    applications that can be started by clicking a link on a web
    page. In order to start them by clicking, the web browser must
    know about Oz applets (or Oz applications as we also call them).

    <Title/Enabling Oz Applets under Windows/
    <p>
    The modifications described below only have to be done by Unix
    users. Under Windows the installation process will automatically
    do the necessary modifications for you. If that fails for some
    reason, please follow the instructions below, but use
<code display>
"C:\Program Files\Mozart\bin\ozenginew.exe" "%1"
</code>
   as application (assuming that you installed Mozart under <Kbd>C:\Program Files\Mozart)</Kbd>.


  <Section id="section.applets.oz">
    <Title/Oz Applications/

    <p>
      Application execution in a web browser (and also by mail tools,
      etc.) is controlled by MIME types. An Oz
      application has the MIME type
      <Kbd>application/x-oz-application</Kbd> and the
      filename extension <Kbd/oza/.

    <p>
      To make your Web Browser or E-Mail tool Oz application enabled,
      it needs to
      know the following bits of information:
      <List>
        <Entry>Mime type
        <Item> This is <Kbd>application/x-oz-application</Kbd>.
        <Entry>File extension
        <Item> This is <Kbd>oza</Kbd>.
        <Entry>Program location
        <Item> Where the Oz engine to execute Applications resides. For
        example, if Mozart has been installed in
        <Kbd>/usr/local/oz</Kbd>, this is
        <Kbd>/usr/local/oz/bin/ozengine</Kbd>.
      </List>
    </P>
