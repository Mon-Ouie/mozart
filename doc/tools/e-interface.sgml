  <P>
    The graphical user interface of the Explorer is shown in <Ptr
    to="Figure.Explorer.Interface">. The main components of the
    graphical user interface are as follows.
  </P>

  <Para Class=Apropos><Title/Menu Bar/
    The <Em/menu bar/ gives access to the Explorer's
    operations. Accelerators to operations are available with the keyboard
    and with the mouse. <Ptr to="Section.Explorer.Menu"> describes the 
    operations.
  </Para>

  <Para Class=Apropos><Title/Scale Bar/
    The <Em/scale bar/ allows to scale the search tree. Clicking with
    the right mouse button scales the search tree such that it fits
    the size of the window (if possible).
  </Para>

  <Para Class=Apropos><Title/Scrollbars/
    With the vertical and horizontal <Em/scrollbars/ the visible part
    of the search tree can be adjusted. 
  </Para>

  <Para Class=Apropos><Title/Status Bar/
    The <Em/status bar/ contains status information on the Explorer
    and on the search tree. See <Ptr to=Section.Explorer.Status> for more
    information. 
  </Para>

  <Para Class=Apropos><Title/Selected Node/
    Within the search tree, a single node can be selected. The
    selected node is drawn shadowed. Most operations execute with
    respect to the currently selected node or with respect to the
    subtree starting at the currently selected node.  
  </Para>

  <Para Class=Apropos><Title/Current Node, Current Subtree/
    To the selected node (subtree) we also refer to as the <Def
    class=term/current node/ (<Def class=term/current subtree/). 
  </Para>

  <P>
    <Ptr to="Figure.Explorer.Interface"> does not show the mouse
    pointer. From the mouse pointer one can get additional status
    information. This is explained in <Ptr to="Section.Explorer.Status">.
