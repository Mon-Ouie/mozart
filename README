This is a straight port of the GNOME Cavnas from the stable gnome-libs 1.2.4
back to gtk+.  Thw widget is called GtkCanvas. To compile and to install it,
follow the standard GNU tool convention:

./configure --prefix=(destin dir path)
make 
make install

This widget behaves identically to the GnomeCanvas widget, with the same APIs, 
except the names are changed from gnome_canvas to gtk_canvas.  Thus you can use
the GNOME documentation on this widget.  The test-gtkcanvas program in the test
directory can serve as a starting point on learning to use the widget.

Currently the widget still depends on GdkImLib, which is available from 

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/imlib/

Modern GNU/Linux distributions like Red Hat should come with it already.  Since
the next version of gtk+ will drop GdkImLib and intgrate with gdk-pixbuf, it
is expected that future versions of this widget will depend upon gtk+ only.

This distribution contains libart_lgpl.

I intend to have GtkCanvas follows GnomeCanvas closely and merges new code
whenever a stable release of the latter is made.  Thus this is not really a
fork but rather a "re-packaging" of the same code.  I recommend that you
consider using the GNOME libraries first before using this widget, as the GNOME
framework provides many services, much more than a canvas widget.  

If the gtk+ maintainers decide someday to place this widget into gtk+, then I
shall turn this to them and stop distribute this widget separately.

The test-gtkcanvas program is  licensed under the GNU GPL (please see the file

Again, I basically did a re-packing.  The main authors of this software were
Federico Mena <quartic@gimp.org> (GnomeCanvas) and Raph Levien <raph@acm.org>
(libart_lgpl).
