This is the conversion of the Mozart repository from svn to git.

The original svn was not in the format expected by git-svn. In particular,
git-svn  expect:

<subproject>/trunk/<files>
<subproject>/branches/<branch>/<files>
<subproject>/tags/<tag>/<files>

and we were much closer to:

trunk/<subproject>/<files>
branches/<branch>/<subproject>/<files>
tags/<tag>/<subproject>/<files>

except that a few branches & tags where of the form

branches/<branch>/<files>
tags/<tag>/<files>

with an implicit subproject.
One branch even started as branches/<branch>/<files> before being moved to branches/<branch>/<subproject>/<files>.
The conversion was done by using:

git svn init -T/ --username mozart https://gforge.info.ucl.ac.be/svn/mozart/
git svn fetch

which produced a purely linear history of the repository. Scripts where then used to produce histories for each subproject.
The files can be found in conv-tools but are not intended for generic use as they were designed as one-offs.

The retarget script is intended to reconfigure the git repository it's called from into one for some subproject of the Mozart repository. See "retarget -h" for details.
