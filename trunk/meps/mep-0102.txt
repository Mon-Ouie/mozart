Abstract
========

The purpose of this MEP is to give Boris Mejias (bmc@info.ucl.ac.be)
check-in (commit) privileges to Mozart's CVS repository.


Motivation
==========

Boris is integrating the Distributed SubSystem (DSS) [#DSSsite]_
[#DSS]_ into the Mozart System.  By giving Boris check-in privileges
this work can be carried out on a branch of the official Mozart CVS
repository. This will:

1 ensure that the full history of this integration remains within the
  Mozart CVS repository (the CVS history of DSS development to this
  point is maintained in another repository). 

2 ensure that the integrated prototype is available to Mozart
  developers and users for evaluation and debugging.


Background
==========

The current implementation of the distribution layer of the Mozart
system is tightly bound with the centralised emulator. Since the code
is not modularised, the task of adding new distributed behaviour and
fixing bugs becomes very difficult. We propose to introduce the DSS as
an independent component for distribution support, implementing a glue
layer to couple the centralised engine with the DSS.

The DSS is middle-ware that provides efficient distribution support
for different programming languages. It has been implemented by Mozart
developers and it fits well with the semantics of the Oz language.

The implementation is based in a prototype [#GLUE]_ created at SICS by
Erik Klintskog and Zacharias El Banna (DSS developers) using an old
version of Mozart. 

Once the integration is sufficiently functional and stable a separate
MEP will be proposed to cover the integration of the DSS branch into
the main trunk.
