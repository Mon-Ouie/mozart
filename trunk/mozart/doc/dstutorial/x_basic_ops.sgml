<SECTION><TITLE>Global naming</TITLE>

Global names are needed when an application
wants to interact with the world outside it.
Mozart supports three basic kinds of global names:

<LIST>
<ITEM> A <EM>ticket</EM> is a string that references a data
structure inside a running application.
Tickets are created by Mozart and
can be used to connect running applications together.
<ITEM> A <EM>URL</EM> is a string that references
a file across the network.
The string follows the standard URL syntax.
In Mozart the file can be a <EM>pickle</EM>, in which case
it can hold any kind of stateless data--procedures,
classes, records, strings, etc.
<ITEM> A <EM>hostname</EM> is a string that
refers to a host (another machine) across the network.
The string follows the standard DNS syntax.
An application can use the hostname to start up another
Mozart process there.
</LIST>

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Connecting applications with tickets</TITLE>

Let's say Application 1 has a stream that
it wants others to access.
It can do this by creating a ticket
that references the stream.
The module <<Connection>> implements tickets.
Application 1 first creates a ticket for the stream
by using <<Connection>> as follows:

<<<
declare Stream Tkt in
{Connection.offer Stream Tkt}
{Show Tkt}
>>>

Then Application 1 publishes the ticket somewhere so that
other applications can access it.
Our example displays
the ticket string in the emulator window.
We will use copy and paste to communicate the ticket
to another application.
The ticket looks something like
<<'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'>>.
Don't worry about exactly what's inside the ticket.
Users don't normally see tickets:
they are stored in files or passed across the network,
e.g., in mail messages.
Application 2 can use the ticket to get a reference
to the stream:

<<<
declare Stream in
{Connection.take 
   'x-ozticket://193.10.66.30:9002:SpGK0:U4v/y:s:f:xl'
   Stream}
{Browse Stream}
>>>

If Application 1 binds the stream
by doing <<Stream=a|b|c|_>>
then Application 2's browse window will show the bindings.


<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Persistent data structures</TITLE>

An application can save
any stateless data structure
in a file and load it again from a file.
The loading may be done from a URL, used as 
a file's global name.
The module <<Pickle>> implements the saving
and loading, and the conversion to and from
the file format.

For example, let's define a function and save it:

<<<
declare
fun {Fact N}
   if N=<1 then 1 else X*{Fact N-1} end
end

{Pickle.save Fact "~pvr/public_html/fact"}
>>>

Since the function is in a <<public_html>> directory,
anyone can load it by giving a URL that specifies
the file:

<<<
declare
Fact={Pickle.load "http://www.sics.se/~pvr/fact"}

{Browse {Fact 10}}
>>>

Anything stateless can be saved in a pickle,
including functions, procedures, classes,
records, and atoms.
Stateful entities, such as objects and variables,
cannot be pickled.

<SUBSECTION><TITLE>Remote computations</TITLE>

An application can start a computation
on a given host that uses the resources
of that host and
that continues to interact with the
application.
The computation is specified as a functor,
which is the standard way to
define computations with the resources they need.

First we create a new Mozart process
that is ready to accept new computations:
<<<
declare
R={New Remote.manager init(host:"sinuhe.sics.se")}
>>>

Let's make the process do some work:
<<<
declare F X in
F=functor define X={Fact 30} end

{R apply(name:"" F)}  % Do the calculation remotely

{Browse X}            % See the answer
>>>

If the remote computation needs resources,
you have to specify the base URL for the resources.
