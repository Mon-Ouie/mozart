      <dd><p>documents all built-in modules of the system.  These are part
of the language definition and implement the basic operations on the
values of the Oz universe.  The base modules are typically organized
by type, for example the <code>Record</code> module contains all operations
on record values.</p>

      <dt><a href="../system/" class=section name=system>The System Modules Reference
Manual</a></dt>
      <dd><p>documents all library modules that are delivered with the
system.  They implement higher-level facilities and can be classified
into six thematic collections:
Application Programming,
Constraint Progamming,
Distributed Programming,
Open Programming,
System Programming,
Window Programming.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="../opi/" class=section name=opi>The Oz Programming
Interface</a></dt>
      <dd><p>aka the OPI, is implemented as an Emacs package which permits
convenient interactive sessions with a running Mozart system.  It also
provides <code>oz-mode</code>, with <code>font-lock</code> support, for editing
files of Oz code.</p>

      <dt><a href="../tools/" class=section name=tools>The Oz Tools Reference
Manual</a></dt>
      <dd><p>documents documents the graphical tools (browser, panel,
explorer) and the command line tools (compiler, linker, debugger, profiler)
supplied with the system.</p>

      <dt><a href="../compiler/" class=section name=compiler>The Oz Compiler</a></dt>
      <dd><p>can be
characterized as an evaluator which takes as input a pair of a program
string and an environment and returns an Oz value...</p>

      <dt><a href="../ozcar/" class=section name=debugger>The Oz Debugger</a></dt>
      <dd><p>aka
<code>ozcar</code>, supports all the traditional features we have come to
expect from debuggers, such as the ability to single step, to set
break points, to inspect values, etc...  Additionally it fully
supports the debugging of concurrent programs with multiple threads;
their concurrent behaviour can be observed and manipulated. Source
code debugging is made available through the OPI with highlighting of
the current source line.</p>

      <dt><a href="../profiler/" class=section name=profiler>The Oz Profiler</a></dt>
      <dd><p>makes it
possible to gather data about procedure calls, time spent, and memory
allocation.  Such information may reveal bottlenecks in your
application which it may be worthwhile to optimize.</p>
