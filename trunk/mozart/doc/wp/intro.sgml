    <P>
      Mozart comes with an object-oriented interface to Tcl/Tk,
      a powerful tool for programming graphical user interfaces.  The
      functionality of all graphical objects comes in form of classes,
      which are subject to possibly multiple inheritance.  Windows are
      described compositionally by means of object hierarchies and are
      subject to dynamic and interactive modification.  
    <P>
      The interface substitutes &Oz; for the low-level Tcl (an event-driven
      script language).  By this, the interface inherits from &Oz; concurrency,
      objects and first-class procedures.  From Tcl/Tk the interface inherits
      a set of powerful graphical abstractions.  The large number of available
      graphical abstractions built on top of Tcl/Tk can be integrated
      smoothly.
