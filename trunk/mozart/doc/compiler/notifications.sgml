  <Title/Sent Notifications/
  <P>
    This section summarizes all notifications currently sent by the
    Mozart Compiler to the registered interfaces.
  <P>
    Note that source coordinates (usually called <<Coord>>) are always
    either <<unit>>, meaning there's no information, or of the form
    <<pos(FileName Line Column)>>, where <<FileName>> is an atom
    (<<''>> meaning there's none available) and <<Line>> and <<Column>>
    are integers.  Line numbering begins at&nbsp;1 and column numbering
    at&nbsp;0; a column number of <<~1>> means that none is known.

	  being executed.
	<Entry><<removeQuery(?_{Id})>>
	<Item>
	  The query with identification number ?_{Id} has been removed
	  from the query queue, either because it finished executing

	<Entry><<message(?_{Record} ?_{Coord})>>
	<Item>
	  An error or warning message ?_{Record}, related to the source
	  coordinates ?_{Coord}, is to be output.  ?_{Record} has the

	  <File>mozart/share/lib/sp/Error.oz</File>.
	<Entry><<insert(?_{FilenameVS} ?_{Coord})>>
	<Item>
	  During parsing, the file named ?_{FilenameVS} has been read.
	  The corresponding <<\insert>> directive (if any) was at source
	  coordinates ?_{Coord}.
	<Entry><<displaySource(?_{TitleVS} ?_{ExtVS} ?_{VS})>>
	<Item>
	  A source text ?_{VS} with title ?_{TitleVS} is to be displayed;
