  <Title>The Used Notation
  <P>
    This appendix describes the notation used to specify the syntax of the
    Gump specification language as an extension of the Oz language.  It is
    an extended Backus-Naur-Formalism built from the following parts:
    <LIST>
      <Item>
	<P>
	   terminals and nonterminals are enclosed in angle brackets
	   <Math>\langle\ldots\rangle</Math>;
      <Item>
	<P>
	  the left side is separated from the right side by either ::= or
	  +=, where += adds productions to an existing nonterminal;
      <Item>
	<P>
	  the vertical bar separates alternatives;
      <Item>
	<P>
	  square brackets denote optional phrases;
      <Item>
	<P>
	  curly braces enclose phrases that may be repeated 0 to <Math
	  >n</Math>&nbsp;times;
      <Item>
	<P>
	  curly braces with a suffixed&nbsp;+ enclose phrases that may be
	  repeated 1 to <Math>n</Math>&nbsp;times;
      <Item>
	<P>
	  literal strings are set in <Code>typewriter</Code>.
    </LIST>
  <Section><Title>Elements from the Oz Syntax
    <PARA CLASS=apropos><TITLE/Lexical Conventions/
      Since the tool's specification language is embedded into Oz, the same
      lexical conventions apply as for Oz.  The only additional terminal type
      is ?={regex}, described in <PTR TO="section.scanner.syntax"
      CLASS="Section">.
    <PARA CLASS=apropos><TITLE/Terminals/
      The following terminals from the Oz syntax are used:
      <LIST>
	<ENTRY>?={atom}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    stands for an Oz atom (quoted or not).
	<ENTRY>?={variable}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    denotes an Oz variable (backquoted or not).
	<ENTRY>?={atom label}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    is an Oz atom that is immediately followed by a left parenthesis.
	<ENTRY>?={variable label}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    is an Oz variable that is immediately followed by a left
	    parenthesis.
      </LIST>
    <PARA CLASS=apropos><TITLE/Nonterminals/
      Furthermore, the following nonterminals from the Oz syntax are used:
      <LIST>
	<ENTRY>?={escaped variable}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    stands for an Oz variable that may optionally be preceded by an
	    exclamation mark, preventing its implicit declaration.
	<ENTRY>?={phrase}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    is an Oz statement or expression.  This distinction is not made
	    by the context-free syntax; it is stated informally in the
	    descriptions instead.
	<ENTRY>?={class descriptor}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    stands for a class descriptor, &IE;, one of <Code
	    proglang="gump">from</Code>, <Code proglang="gump">prop</Code>,
	    <Code
	    proglang="gump">attr</Code> or <Code proglang="gump">feat</Code>.
	<ENTRY>?={method}
	<Item>
	  <P>
	    stands for a <Code proglang="gump">meth</Code> &Ellipsis; <Code
	    proglang="gump">end</Code> definition.
      </LIST>
