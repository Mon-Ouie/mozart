# $CVSid: @(#)loginfo 1.5 92/03/31 $
#
#
# The "loginfo" file is used to control where "cvs commit" log information
# is sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  If a match is found, then the remainder of the line is a filter
# program that should expect log information on its standard input.
#
# The filter program may use one and only one % modifier (ala printf).  If
# %s is specified in the filter program, a brief title is included (enclosed
# in single quotes) showing the modified file names.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name ALL appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or DEFAULT.
