  <title/First-class Computation Spaces: <<Space>>/

<p>
First-class computation spaces can be used to program inference
engines for problem solving.

<list>
<entry><Span class=index/<<is>>/
<index class=tails/<<Space>><And><<is>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.is ?+{X} ??{B}}>>
<item>
tests whether ?_{X} is a space.

<entry><<new>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<new>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.new ?+{P} ??{Space}}>>
<item>
returns a newly created space, in which a thread containing an
application of the unary procedure&nbsp;?_{P} to the root variable of
?_{Space} is created.

<entry><<ask>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<ask>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.ask ?+{Space} ??{T}}>>
<item>
waits until ?_{Space} becomes stable or merged and then returns the
status of ?_{Space}. 
<p>
If ?_{Space} is merged, the atom <<merged>> is returned.
<p>
If ?_{Space} is stable and:
<list>
<entry>failed
<item>the atom <<failed>> is returned.
<entry>succeeded
<item>and there are no threads in ?_{Space} synchronizing on
choices,  the atom <<succeeded>> is returned.
<entry>succeeded
<item>and there is at least one thread in ?_{Space} which
synchronizes on a choice the tuple <<alternatives(?{I})>> is returned, where ?{I} gives the number of alternatives of the selected choice.
</list>

<p>
Synchronizes on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error if the current space is not admissible
for ?_{Space}.

<entry><<askVerbose>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<askVerbose>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.askVerbose ?+{Space} ??{T}}>>
<item>
returns the status of ?_{Space} in verbose form. Reduces immediately, even if ?_{Space} is not yet stable. --Need a change--
<p>
If ?_{Space} becomes merged, the atom <<merged>> is returned.
<p>
If ?_{Space} becomes suspended (that is, blocked but not stable), ?_{T} is bound to the tuple
<<suspended(?{T1})>>. ?{T1} is a future that is bound to the status of
?_{Space} when ?_{Space} becomes unblocked again.
<p>
If ?_{Space} is stable and:
<list>
<entry>failed
<item>the atom <<failed>> is returned.
<entry>succeeded
<item>and there are no threads in ?_{Space} synchronizing on
choices,  the tuple <<succeeded(?{A})>> is returned.
The atom ?{A} is either <<stuck>>, when ?_{Space} still contains threads, or <<entailed>> otherwise. 
<entry>succeeded
<item>and there is at least one thread in ?_{Space} which
synchronizes on a choice the tuple <<alternatives(?{I})>> is returned,
where ?_{I} gives the number of alternatives of the selected choice. 
</list>

<p>
Does not synchronize on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error if the current space is not admissible
for ?_{Space}.

<!--
<entry><<merge>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<merge>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.merge ?+{Space} ?_{X}}>>
<item>
merges ?_{Space} with the current space and constrains ?_{X} to the
root variable of ?_{Space}. <<not_working>>

<p>
Does not synchronize on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error if ?_{Space} is already merged, or if the
current space is not admissible for ?_{Space}.
-->

<entry><<clone>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<clone>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.clone ?+{Space1} ??{Space2}}>>
<item>
blocks until ?_{Space1} becomes stable and returns a new space
which is a copy of ?_{Space1}.

<p>
Synchronizes on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error if ?_{Space} is already merged, or if the
current space is not admissible for ?_{Space}.


<entry><<inject>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<inject>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.inject ?+{Space} ?+{P}}>>
<item>
creates a thread in the space ?_{Space} which contains an application
of the unary procedure&nbsp;?_{P} to the root variable of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Does not synchronize on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error if ?_{Space} is already merged, or if the
current space is not admissible for ?_{Space}.


<entry><<kill>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<kill>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.kill ?+{Space}}>>
<item>
kills a space by injecting failure into ?_{Space}. 

<p>Can be defined by
<<<
proc {Space.kill S}
   {Space.inject S proc {$ _} fail end}
end
>>>

<p>
Does not synchronize on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error if ?_{Space} is already merged, or if the
current space is not admissible for ?_{Space}.

<entry><<commit>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<commit>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.commit ?+{Space} ?+{IT}}>>
<item>
blocks until ?_{Space} becomes stable and then commits to alternatives
of the selected choice of ?_{Space}.

<p>
If ?_{IT} is a pair of integers <<?{l}#?{r}>> then all but the
?{l}, ?{l} + 1, &ellipsis;, ?{r} alternatives of the selected choice 
of ?_{Space} are discarded. If a single
alternative remains, the topmost choice is replaced by this alternative.
If no alternative remains, the space is failed.

<p>
An integer value for ?_{IT} is an abbrevation for the pair
<<?_{IT}#?_{IT}>>.

<p>
Synchronizes on stability of ?_{Space}.

<p>
Raises a runtime error, if ?_{Space} has been merged already, if
there exists no selected choice in ?_{Space}, or if the current
space is not admissible for ?_{Space}.


<entry><<waitStable>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<waitStable>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.waitStable}>>
<item>
blocks until the current space (the space that
hosts the current thread) becomes
stable. <<Space.waitStable>> is used mainly for
programming distribution strategies (see for
example <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:fdt"
key="chapter.user-defined">), where for accurate
variable selection it is required that all
propagation has been carried out.
<p>
If executed in the toplevel space, it will block
forever. 


<entry><<getChoice>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<getChoice>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.getChoice ??{X}}>>
<item>
blocks until either the current space becomes stable (without branching), or a branch has been commited to the current space. If there is no branching and space is stable atom nil is returned. If a branch <<B>> has been commited, ?_{X} is bound to <<B>>.

<entry><<branch>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<branch>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.branch ?+{L}}>>
<item>
Sets the branchings of the current space to be the ones in list ?_{L}. This primitive terminates inmediately. Branches in ?_{L} are exactly the ones that appear in the tuple  <<branching([B1 ... Bn])>> returned by <<ask>>.


<entry><<choose>>
<index class=tails/<<Space>><and><<choose>>/
<synopsis>
<<{Space.choose ?+{I1} ??{I2}}>>
<item>
blocks until the current space becomes
stable. When the current space becomes stable it
creates a choice point with ?_{I1}
alternatives. ?_{I2} is bound to the value
selected by <<Space.commit>>. Reduces as soon as
?_{I2} becomes bound.

<p>
<<Space.choose>> is not a primitive anymore as it can be implemented in terms of <<Space.branch>> and <<Space.getChoice>>.
<<<
 fun {Choose N}
     %% create the branching
     {Branch {List.number 1 N 1}}
     %% wait for the commitment
     case {GetChoice} of [I] then I end
 end
>>>

<p>
If executed in the toplevel space, it will block
forever.
