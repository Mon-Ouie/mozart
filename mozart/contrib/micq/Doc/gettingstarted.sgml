<CHAPTER ID="chapter.gettingstarted">
<TITLE/Getting Started/
<P>Before you can run &micq;, you must download and install Mozart

<SECTION><TITLE/Getting Started/
<P>We assume in this brief introduction, that it is the first time you run the client.
<P>Click <REF.EXTERN TO="http://www.sics.se/mozart/mim/client.oza">here</REF.EXTERN> to start a client!

<P>The first window you will get looks like this:

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="1_login.gif">

<P>Fill in Login and password. If it is the first
time you connect, select a login and a password you would like. Use
<KEY/TAB/ to traverse between the fields. Press <KEY/RETURN/ when
done.

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="2_noaccount.gif">

<P>Since this is the first time you connect,
you do not have an account. Press the button "Create
Account" to continue.

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="3_newaccount.gif">

<P>Fill in all the fields, press <KEY/RETURN/ when done.

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="4_emptyclient.gif">

<P>This is your client, click on the <EM/"M"/-logotype and you will get the following popup.

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="5_menu.gif">

<P>Press "Add Friends" to add people to your contact list.

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="6_searchfriends.gif">

<P>Fill in the information you know about the person you are looking
for. The search is case insensitive and we do not use exact word
match. Our search algorithm is based on sub-strings. For example: The
authors organization is "Swedish Institute of Computer Science", if
you type "sics" the match will be done on the following 
letters: "<KEY/s/wed<KEY/i/sh institute of <KEY/c/omputer <KEY/s/cience". There is
an AND-relation between the search-fields.

<P><PICTURE.EXTERN TYPE="gif" TO="7_selectfriends.gif">

<P>Select the people you want to add to
your contact list. Use <KEY/CTR/ or <KEY/SHIFT/ as modifier.

<P>Press "Add Selected Friends" when done.

<P>Now your client looks something like this:
