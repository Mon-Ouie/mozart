Abstract
========

The purpose of this MEP is to transfer Mozart governance from
the Mozart Consortium to representative members of the Mozart
community.  To this end, the MEP proposes an expanded Board 
to replace the initial Board.  The initial Board was chosen
to represent the Mozart Consortium.  The expanded Board will
represent the Mozart community.  The proposed expanded Board
consists of the following people:

   * `Raphaël Collet`_
   * `Denys Duchier`_
   * `Seif Haridi`_
   * `Torbjörn Lager`_
   * `Konstantin Popov`_
   * Camilo Rueda
   * `Christian Schulte`_
   * `Gert Smolka`_
   * `Peter Van Roy`_

Rationale
=========

The expanded Board consists of people who have shown technical
competence and activity in Mozart development.  From the Mozart
community, the new members are Torbjörn Lager and Camilo Rueda.
Torbjörn Lager is a faculty member at Gothenburg University and
a prominent Mozart developer and researcher in natural language
processing who has given intensive Mozart courses.  Camilo Rueda
is a faculty member at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and
a prominent researcher and head of a research group (together
with Juan Diaz) that is using Mozart for constraint programming
and computer science education.  Both of these proposed members
agree to be on the Board.

In addition, two members are added from within the Mozart
Consortium: Konstantin Popov from SICS and Raphaël Collet from
UCL.  These members are added because SICS/KTH and UCL are very
active in Mozart research and development.  Both of these
proposed members agree to be on the Board.

This gives a total of nine members covering the various areas
of Mozart research and development.  We consider that nine
members is just about right: it is large enough to cover the
different areas of Mozart work and small enough to make the
Board an effective instrument.
