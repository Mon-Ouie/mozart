<ITEM> <<insertbackground:C>> : Specifies the color to use as background in the area covered by the insertion cursor. This color will
    normally override either the normal background for the widget (or the selection background if the
    insertion cursor happens to fall in the selection). <<C>> must be a valid color (see <ptr to="misc.color">).
