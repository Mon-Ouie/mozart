<ITEM> <<disabledforeground:C>> : Specifies foreground color to use when drawing a disabled element. If the option is specified as an empty string (which is typically
    the case on monochrome displays), disabled elements are drawn with the normal foreground color but they are dimmed by drawing
    them with a stippled fill pattern. <<C>> must be a valid color (see <ptr to="misc.color">)
