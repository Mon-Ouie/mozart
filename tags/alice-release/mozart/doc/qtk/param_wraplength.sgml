<ITEM> <<wraplength:P>> : For widgets that can perform word-wrapping, this option specifies the maximum line length. Lines that
    would exceed this length are wrapped onto the next line, so that no line is longer than the specified length. If this value is less than or equal to 0 then no wrapping is done: lines will break only at newline characters in the text. <<P>> must be a valid screen distance (see  <ptr to="misc.distance">)
