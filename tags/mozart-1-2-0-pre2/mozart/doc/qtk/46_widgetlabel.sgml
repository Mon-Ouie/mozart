  <TITLE>Label widget</TITLE>

<subsection> <TITLE>Description</TITLE>

<P>
A label is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image. If text is displayed, it must all be in a
single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs
because of the wrapLength option) and one of the characters may optionally be underlined using the
underline option. The label can be manipulated in a few simple ways, such as changing its relief or
text, using the commands described below. 

<subsection> <TITLE>Parameters</TITLE>
