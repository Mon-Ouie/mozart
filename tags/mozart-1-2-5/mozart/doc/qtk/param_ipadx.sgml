<ITEM> <<ipadx:P>> : Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request for the widget in the
    X-direction. When computing how
    large a window it needs, the widget will add this amount to the width it would normally need (as
    determined by the width of the things displayed in the widget); if the geometry manager can satisfy this
    request, the widget will end up with extra internal space to the left and/or right of what it displays inside.
    Most widgets only use this option for padding text: if they are displaying a bitmap or image, then they
    usually ignore padding options. <<P>> must be a valid screen distance (see  <ptr to="misc.distance">)
