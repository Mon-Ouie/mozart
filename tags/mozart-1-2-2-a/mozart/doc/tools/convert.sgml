  <Title/Conversion of Pickles: <code/convertTextPickle//
  <p>
    If you had saved data structures into pickles with Mozart&nbsp;1.0.1,
    then you'll want to use them in newer releases of Mozart as well.
    The format of pickles has changed after 1.0.1, however.  This command
    line utility can help you to convert pickles.  Concerning limitations
    and how to overcome them, please refer to the <Ref.Extern
    to="ozdoc:contrib" key="chapter.compat"/compat/ module.
