Each contribution needs to be configured and installed separately
because each may need to be linked with specific libraries not required
by the rest of the system.

Each contribution has a global name, e.g.:

	www.ps.uni-sb.de/ozhome/contrib/gdbm

An architecture independent file gdbm.ozc is referenced by:

	http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/ozhome/contrib/gdbm/gdbm.ozc

An architecture dependent file, such as a (C++) shared object library
gdbm.so is referenced by:

	www.ps.uni-sb.de/ozhome/contrib/gdbm/gdbm.so

./configure --prefix=$HOME/.oz

	should cause the all arch independent files to get installed in

	$HOME/.oz/cache/http/www.ps.uni-sb.de/ozhome/contrib/gdbm

	and all architecture dependent files e.g. on linux in

	$HOME/.oz/platform/linux-i486/www.ps.uni-sb.de/ozhome/contrib/gdbm

By default the prefix should be $OZHOME (typically /usr/local/oz)
