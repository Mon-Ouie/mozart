-- allow children to be specified in feature `children' instead of under
   features 1..N (will facilitate to generate specs, without using
   Adjoin and List.toRecord)

-- support the canvas in GBuilderWidgets

-- handle freeing on destroy signal (e.g., makeStrArr in GBuilderTypes):
   some fromOz conversions in GBuilderTypes allocate data structures
   which need to be explicitly freed, this currently never happens
