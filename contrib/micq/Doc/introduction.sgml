<CHAPTER ID="chapter.intro">
<TITLE/Introduction/
<P>Mozart-ICQ (&micq;) is an implementation inspired by the popular program ICQ
(<REF.EXTERN TO="http://www.icq.com">www.icq.com</REF.EXTERN>).
The &micq; system is an example of what can be accomplished in a short period when a language like Mozart is used.

<P>The whole system consists of 5000 lines of code, my guess is that 2/3 of all lines are related to the User-Interface.

<SECTION><TITLE/Features/
<P>At this moment the system offers:

<LIST>

<ITEM>Contact list. Search for friends (by name, email or
organization) and add them to your contact list. The contact list lets
you to see when your friends are <EM>online</EM>/<EM>away</EM>/<EM>offline</EM>.

<ITEM>Messaging. Send store-and-forward messages to friends. You will
be notified when the receiver has read the message.

<ITEM>Applications. It is possible to start a chat server and invite
your friends to join. Other applications are GO - a Japanese board
game, Multi-worms and a chess game.

<ITEM>Extensible. We provide an interface to hook in application that
the users can run. For example, the chat system is not a core part of
the system; rather it is a standalone application.

<ITEM>Security 1.  Unreliable applications that you launch on your
Computer will not have access to your local file system, etc. We have
not solved resource accounting, but we hope to take a closer look at
it in the future.

<ITEM>Security 2. Since the source is available, we have protection
against hooking up modified clients. In short, we can say that clients
can only communicate with a special instance of the server.

<ITEM>Persistent database. All client settings and the contact list
are stored on the server. This means that you can start your &micq;
client at work or home. Read messages and sent messages will be stored
on your local file system.

<ITEM>The source code is free! If this is a feature, I do not know?!
Who wants to read 5000 lines of uncommented source code? We made this
system in 4 weeks, maybe the design is weird in some places. I still
think it is a great resource to learn from anyway and there is a lot
of useful stuff hidden in the source!

</LIST>

<SECTION><TITLE/Coming features/
<P>We have plans to introduce RSA cryptography of messages, resource
accounting, and instant messaging (not letting the messages pass
through a server). More cool applications, such as file-transfer,
transaction based whiteboard, blackboards, etc.
