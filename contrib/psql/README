This is an interface to the PostgreSQL database.  You
can connect to local or remote sites.

It has only been tested on Linux so far.

If you are able to use the supplied binary, just
type "./test" to run it.  

- To compile, it requires that you have libpq (the postgres 
  library) installed on your computer.

- To compile, edit the Makefile and make sure that the 
  PSQLDIR variable points to the postgres installation.
  Actually, it doesn't require that you have all of
  PostgreSQL installed, just libpq and some C header files.

- Make also sure that the OZHOME variable is set.

- Then just type "make".  

To test if it works, you must have the authority to connect
to an existing PostgreSQL database.  You can try the file
test.oz or modify it to your local database by setting the 
"host" and "dbname", and if you must, supply a "user" and "password".

This is how you use it when you have imported the Psql module.
The query result is returned as a list of records.

   SQL = {Psql.startSQL
          "host=pets.sics.se dbname=ozstuff "#
	  "user=ozuser password=mozart"}
      
   {ForAll {SQL.query "SELECT * FROM person where age<25"} System.show}

OBS!  Remember that the user must be granted priviliges to
read from the table, or else an exception is raised.
