//** Introduction 

The Distribution Panel

The Distribution panel is a tool for monitoring the behavior of the distribution part of a Mozart engine. With its help it is possible to obtain a understanding of what is happening under the surface of your Mozart engine. Tuning of applications and unexpected behaviors can be detected. To fully understand the information that the Distribution panel displays the Mozart distribution must be understod, see seif and Peters documents.

Usage 

The Distribution panel is started by feeding the line 

 {DistPanel.open} 

The Distribution panel monitors and displays important distribution data. The data is retreived through native interfaces that are not exposed to the user. Transforming the data into a viewable format can be a memory consuming task. In such a case it is advised to not use the Distribution panel to avoid unexpected behaviors.

How to understand what you see.

The Distribution panel uses sampeling to get its information. The graphs that show information per sample displays what has happened since the last sample. 
When the distribution behavior is affected by the garbage collector a red vertical bar is inserted in all graphs when garbage colelction ocours. With this garbage collection bar as "hållpunkt" some behaviors that are gc related can be observed.
