  class Timers contains an abstraction on top of the task manager to make
  it easy to set and reset an arbitrary number of timers.
  The users are responsible of storing a timerelement that is handled by Timers
  and contains necesary information. This may not be alterd by the users, and
  must be cleared by clearTimer before the user seises to exist.
  Elapsed timers cause procedures provided when the timer is set to be invoked.
