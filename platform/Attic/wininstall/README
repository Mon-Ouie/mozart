The *.inf files are input for Freeman Installer to create executable
files that will install oz2/oz3/emacs when being executed.

Freeman installer is available from

        http://netnet.net/~freeman/

To turn the demo version into a one that does not always show the
"demo", edit fctor.ini:

   [general]

   passwd=overdue

Q: How do I create the exe files:

A: Here is the example for oz3.

   - Under UNIX do: "make oz-win"
     This copies all the files needed for Windows from the installation
     directory into "Oz/oz3"

   - Now invoke Freeman Installer on a Windows machine and open
     "oz3.inf". (it expects to find its input under "Y:\Oz\oz3",
     so make sure that "Y:" is mounted appropriately.

   - Then choose "Run --> Build" in Freeman Installer

   - Have a cup of coffee

   - The step before (no not the one with the coffee) creates:

              C:\prj\online\run\setup.exe.

     Take this file, rename it to oz-<VERSION>.exe and put it onto
     your ftp server.
