Abstract
========

The purpose of this MEP is to make a new release of the Mozart platform.
The new release will:

* Fix various bugs in Mozart 1.3.1

* Add support for recent versions of gcc (gcc 3.4 and 4.0)

The release manager will be Boris Mejias, assisted by Yves Jaradin. In
order to make the release we will need:

* Update access to the website for Boris MejÃ­as

* CVS write access for Yves Jaradin


Motivation
==========

Bugs
----

A fair amount of bugs have been fixed since Mozart 1.3.1 or will be
fixed soon. As the fixes are only available through CVS, many users
continues to fight with these bugs. A bug-fix release is therefore
recommended for the typical users.


GCC
---

Mozart 1.3.1 can't be built with gcc newer than 3.3. Mozart 1.3.2 will
be buildable with (at least) all commonly deployed versions of gcc up
to gcc 4.0.
